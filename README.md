what is the simplest webstack to build a UI on these days wiht agentic toolsl liek GPT or calude code (best n traingn data, etc)
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 12s
Here’s the simplest, low-friction menu that actually ships fast for agentic UIs (GPT/Claude-Code, tools, streaming, eval). Pick one based on your taste.

1) Smallest-possible React stack (my default)
Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript

Vercel AI SDK (handles streaming, tool-calls nicely)

Tailwind + shadcn/ui (fast, clean UI)

Auth.js (only if you need sign-in)

SQLite (Turso/libSQL) or Postgres (Neon/Supabase) + Drizzle ORM

pgvector if you need RAG; otherwise skip vectors entirely at first

Observability: OpenTelemetry + a simple Postgres table (add Langfuse later if you want)

Why: single repo, zero extra infra, edge-friendly, first-class streaming. You can bolt on tools (HTTP endpoints, function-calling) without new services.

Quickstart (shell)

npx create-next-app@latest ai-ui --ts --eslint
cd ai-ui
npm i ai openai @anthropic-ai/sdk drizzle-orm better-sqlite3 tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init -p
Server action (minimal streaming to GPT/Claude)

// app/api/chat/route.ts
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import OpenAI from "openai"; // or Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk"

export const POST = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  const { messages } = await req.json();
  const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });
  const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
    messages,
    stream: true,
  });
  return new Response(
    new ReadableStream({
      async start(controller) {
        for await (const chunk of stream) controller.enqueue(`data: ${JSON.stringify(chunk)}\n\n`);
        controller.close();
      },
    }),
    { headers: { "Content-Type": "text/event-stream" } }
  );
};
Client (very barebones)

// app/page.tsx
"use client";
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Home() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState("");
  const [out, setOut] = useState("");

  const send = async () => {
    const res = await fetch("/api/chat", { method: "POST", body: JSON.stringify({ messages:[{role:"user", content:input}] }) });
    const reader = res.body!.getReader();
    const dec = new TextDecoder();
    setOut("");
    while (true) {
      const { done, value } = await reader.read();
      if (done) break;
      setOut((p) => p + dec.decode(value));
    }
  };

  return (
    <main className="p-6 max-w-2xl mx-auto space-y-4">
      <textarea className="w-full border p-3 rounded" value={input} onChange={e=>setInput(e.target.value)} />
      <button className="px-4 py-2 rounded border" onClick={send}>Run</button>
      <pre className="whitespace-pre-wrap border rounded p-3">{out}</pre>
    </main>
  );
}
2) Smallest-possible Python web stack (if you’re Python-first)
FastAPI + Uvicorn

HTMX + Alpine.js (no React; server-rendered, tiny JS)

Jinja2 templates

SQLite (built-in); add pgvector later if needed

OpenTelemetry for traces; log prompts/latency to SQLite

Why: dead simple, great for enterprises where Docker/K8s is heavy. Debuggable with plain Python.

Quickstart (shell)

pip install fastapi uvicorn jinja2 httpx
App (streaming SSE)

from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
import httpx, os, json

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/chat")
async def chat(req: Request):
    body = await req.json()
    async def gen():
        async with httpx.Stream("POST","https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']}"},
            json={"model":"gpt-4.1-mini","messages":body["messages"],"stream":True}) as r:
            async for chunk in r.aiter_text():
                yield chunk
    return StreamingResponse(gen(), media_type="text/event-stream")
3) Desktop-first (offline-ish, “ship a binary”)
Tauri + React + Vite (tiny, native-feel; calls APIs or local model)

Great if you want local tools (filesystem, ffmpeg) with an agent

Tool-calling (functions) the simple way
In Next.js, let the model return a tool_call and dispatch to server functions (fetch, DB, webhooks). Start with 2–3 tools only (search, fetch_url, run_sql).

In FastAPI, map tool names → Python callables; return tool results back into the stream.

RAG (only when you truly need it)
Start without RAG.

If/when needed: Postgres + pgvector or LiteLLM + LanceDB. Keep ingestion a single script. Don’t overbuild.

Eval & traces (keep it boring)
Log: prompt, tool_calls, latency_ms, tokens_in/out, model to a DB table.

Add OpenTelemetry spans around model calls + tools.

If you later want a UI: drop-in Langfuse or Arize Phoenix (both optional).

Auth, roles, rate limits
Auth.js (Next) or Authlib (FastAPI).

Rate-limit per user with a simple Redis counter (Upstash/Valkey).

Gate tool calls by role (engineer vs viewer).

TL;DR choices
React person / want fastest path: Next.js + Vercel AI SDK + Tailwind/shadcn + SQLite → Postgres later.

Python person / enterprise constraints: FastAPI + HTMX + SQLite → Postgres later.

Local/desktop needs: Tauri + React.

If you tell me your deployment constraints (Vercel ok? Need on-prem? No Docker?), I’ll hand you a copy-paste starter tailored to that environment.

whaty types of tasks woudl scibert be well sutied for
ChatGPT said:
SciBERT is a domain-specific transformer model (BERT variant) trained on scientific text (mainly biomedical and computer science papers from Semantic Scholar). Because its vocabulary and embeddings are tuned to scientific language, it tends to outperform vanilla BERT/RoBERTa on tasks where general models struggle with jargon.

Best-suited tasks
Scientific text classification
e.g., tagging papers by field, classifying sentences into categories (objective, method, result).

Named entity recognition (NER)
Identifying entities in scientific text such as proteins, diseases, algorithms, datasets.

Relation extraction
Extracting scientific relations (e.g., “Drug X inhibits Protein Y”) from biomedical papers.

Sentence similarity / semantic search
Finding related work or similar methods across a corpus of research papers.

Information retrieval
Ranking documents/papers for scientific queries (SciBERT embeddings improve retrieval relevance).

Citation / reference intent classification
Understanding why a paper cites another (background, method comparison, use of dataset, etc.).

Question answering (QA) over scientific text
Given a scientific passage, answer questions that use domain-specific terms.

Knowledge graph construction
Feeding into pipelines that populate scientific/biomedical KGs with entities and edges.

When to use SciBERT
Strong fit: tasks where your input data is dense with scientific vocabulary and long, formal sentence structures.

Overkill / less useful: general domain tasks (tweets, product reviews, legal contracts) where a generic LLM/embedding model is already strong.

⚡ In short: SciBERT shines whenever you want structured understanding of scientific writing—classification, tagging, entity extraction, retrieval.

Do you want me to also compare SciBERT with newer LLM embedding models (like OpenAI text-embedding-3-large or E5-large) so you can see where SciBERT still adds unique value?

You said:
imagine i have a corpus of docs im managing in mendeley. if the corpus grwos larage , i many want my own variant of BERT tha ti can easily build / train unsueprvised to ask qudestion such / do tasks such as thsi ?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 10s
Short answer: yes—you don’t need to train a BERT from scratch. The simplest, high-leverage path is to continue pretraining an existing model on your Mendeley corpus, then (optionally) add lightweight task heads. Here’s a tight menu:

What to build
Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT) — easiest win
Continue masked-language-model (MLM) training on your PDFs (titles/abstracts/full text).

Start from: bert-base-uncased, roberta-base, or SciBERT if your corpus is scientific.

Outcome: a “your-corpus-BERT” that understands your jargon and style.

Good for: classification, NER, retrieval, QA reader.

Task-Adaptive Pretraining (TAPT) — tiny & targeted
Run a short MLM warm-up only on the subset used for a downstream task (e.g., QA passages).

Outcome: boosts when labeled data is scarce.

Domain Embeddings (Sentence-BERT style) — for search/RAG
Fine-tune a sentence-embedding model (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2) with contrastive pairs mined from your library:

Positive pairs: (title, abstract), (paper, its highly similar cites), (intro ↔ conclusion), (paper ↔ its Mendeley “related”/co-cites).

Negative pairs: random papers, different fields.

Outcome: dramatically better semantic search over your corpus.

(Optional) Reranker + Reader for QA

Reranker: monoT5 / cross-encoder to re-score the top-k retrieved passages.

Reader: your DAPT model fine-tuned for extractive QA (SQuAD-style or synthetic Q&A from your docs).

Minimal pipeline (practical)
Ingest & clean

Extract text (GROBID / ScienceParse / pymupdf), keep sections + references.

Normalize unicode, strip boilerplate (headers/footers), dedup near-copies.

Tokenizer

Reuse base model tokenizer. Only train a new tokenizer if OOV rate is high (>1–2% unique tokens broken by subwords).

Continue pretraining (MLM)

Sequence length: start 512; consider 1k–2k if your docs are long (RoBERTa-long/Longformer if needed).

Steps: 50k–200k is often enough for DAPT on a single A100/4090-class GPU.

Mixed precision, gradient accumulation; checkpoint every 5k.

Monitor MLM loss; stop when it plateaus.

Build embeddings

Start with a sentence-transformer; fine-tune contrastively on your mined pairs.

Evaluate with MTEB-style retrieval metrics (nDCG@10, Recall@k) on a held-out slice.

QA stack (RAG)

Index: BM25 + your vector index (FAISS / pgvector).

Query → retrieve top-k → rerank (cross-encoder) → read/answer (extractive head).

Keep it simple first: skip reranker until you need it.

“Unsupervised” ways to get supervision
Citation graph positives: paper ↔ cited-paper (same topic)

Section parallels: (abstract, conclusion) as semantically close

Hard negatives: same venue/year, different keywords

Synthetic Q&A: generate Qs from abstracts; answers from body spans (spot-check a sample)

When to consider from-scratch pretraining
Almost never for this use case—only if your domain is extremely exotic and you have hundreds of millions of tokens plus serious compute. DAPT/TAPT + sentence-embeddings gets 80–90% of the value at 10% of the cost.

Tooling (no-drama)
Hugging Face: datasets, transformers, accelerate, trl (optional)

Sentence-Transformers for embeddings

FAISS / pgvector for search

GROBID for robust PDF → structured text

Langfuse/Arize later for eval/traces (optional)

Quick starts (one-liners)
DAPT (MLM)

python -m transformers.trainer \
  --model_name roberta-base \
  --train_file corpus.txt \
  --do_train --per_device_train_batch_size 16 \
  --num_train_epochs 1 --fp16 --save_steps 5000 \
  --mlm True --max_seq_length 512 --output_dir ./roberta-dapt
Sentence embeddings (contrastive)

from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, InputExample, losses
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
pairs = [InputExample(texts=[title, abstract]) for title, abstract in data]  # add citation pairs too
loader = DataLoader(pairs, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
loss = losses.MultipleNegativesRankingLoss(model)
model.fit(train_objectives=[(loader, loss)], epochs=1, warmup_steps=500, output_path="miniLM-mendeley")
If you tell me your corpus size (docs/tokens) and your GPU budget, I’ll give you concrete hyperparams and an eval plan tuned to your setup.

i would like to use this same approach for a programming language called Ibis (use web search for it). could you come up with a plan incldugin which model to start form for code ismilar to pytohg
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 21s
Short version: Ibis isn’t a separate programming language today—it’s a Python DataFrame library that targets many backends (DuckDB, Postgres, BigQuery, etc.). So your “Ibis model” should be a Python-centric code model plus documentation/search tuned to Ibis’ API and SQL-translation idioms. 
Ibis

DuckDB
ClickHouse

What to build (mirrors your SciBERT plan)
Domain-Adaptive Pretraining for code (DAPT-code)

Start from a Python/code LLM (decoder-only) for generation/autocomplete, and/or a CodeBERT-style encoder for classification/retrieval.

Keep tokenizer; keep context length ≥ 8k if you’ll ingest notebooks/SQL.

Train on: Ibis repo + examples, notebooks, guides, issues/PRs, blog posts, plus your own Ibis codebase. 
GitHub
Ibis
ClickHouse

Task-Adaptive Pretraining (TAPT)

Brief extra pretraining on your Ibis notebooks and pipelines.

Sentence/Code Embeddings for search & RAG

Fine-tune a sentence-embedding model with contrastive pairs mined from Ibis docs:

(title, section), (function, docstring), (API example, rendered SQL), (issue, accepted fix).

Use these for semantic search, “how do I do X in Ibis?”, and retrieval-augmented answers.

Light supervised heads (optional)

Classification (API intent), snippet ranking (reranker), extractive QA over docs.

Models to start from (pragmatic picks)
For generation/completion (decoder-only):

A Python-strong code LLM (7–15B range) fine-tuned with LoRA/QLoRA.

Examples: family like StarCoder-class, Llama-code-class, DeepSeek-coder-class (choose the smallest that meets latency/quality needs).

For encoder tasks (retrieval/classify):

CodeBERT/GraphCodeBERT-class or a modern E5/BGE-class encoder as the base, then DAPT on Ibis text/code.

(Reasoning: Ibis usage is Python; the “language” quirks you need to learn are its expression API and how it maps to SQL backends, not a new syntax—so Python-first code models adapt best.)

Corpus checklist (minimal but high-signal)
Primary: ibis-project/ibis (code, tests, docstrings), “Why Ibis?”, tutorials, backend guides (e.g., DuckDB integration), ClickHouse/Voltron Data posts.

Secondary: high-quality blog posts and “coming from SQL” guides, plus your own notebooks.

Tertiary: StackOverflow/Reddit Q&A threads (curated).

Training sketch
DAPT-code (causal): 50k–200k steps, sequence 2–4k tokens, mix 70% Ibis code/notebooks + 30% docs; keep 5–10% for val.

Instruction tuning (small): SFT on Q→A pairs you synthesize from docs + examples (“translate this pandas to Ibis”, “compose SQL+Ibis”).

Embeddings (contrastive): mine positives via doc structure (heading↔section, code↔docstring) and repo links; add hard negatives from other DF libs (Pandas/Polars) to sharpen “Ibis vs not-Ibis”.

Tasks you’ll unlock
Copilot-style Ibis codegen (compose joins, windows, groupby, .mutate, .aggregate).

“SQL-from-Ibis” explainers (show equivalent SQL for a snippet).

Backend portability hints (warn if expression isn’t supported on backend X).

Retrieval QA over Ibis docs (“How do I window by partition then order?”).

Lint/repair (“replace Pandas idiom with Ibis equivalent”).

Eval (lean & useful)
Code gen: pass@k on held-out Ibis tasks, unit tests that actually run against DuckDB + one remote backend.

RAG: nDCG@10/Recall@k with a labeled query set (“windowed rolling mean”, “anti-join”, “string contains + regex extract”, “to_parquet with partitioning”).

Explainability: golden set mapping Ibis → SQL; BLEU/chrF + human spot checks.

Deployment shape
Embeddings service (your fine-tuned encoder) → vector DB (FAISS/pgvector).

Generator (your LoRA-tuned code LLM) behind a small API.

Guardrails/tools: a “run on DuckDB” tool to execute and return errors; an “explain SQL” tool.

If you share GPU/latency constraints and approx. corpus size (docs, tokens), I’ll pin exact model sizes, LoRA ranks, and a week-one training/eval schedule.

ChatGPT said:
Great — just to clarify before I create the full implementation plan:

Corpus Scope: Will you be training only on the Ibis GitHub repo and docs, or do you also plan to include:

Your own Ibis notebooks or pipelines?

External Ibis-related blogs, tutorials, Q&A (e.g. StackOverflow)?

Model Goals:

Do you want both a code generation model (LLM, causal decoder) and an embedding model (for search/RAG), or just one of those?

Tasks to Support:

What are your priority use cases? (e.g., semantic search over Ibis docs, code suggestion/autocomplete, Ibis-to-SQL explanation, error repair)

Output Preference:

Do you want a full implementation plan in a structured format (like a report with sections and timelines), or more of a high-level checklist or script-heavy notebook format?

Let me know and I’ll tailor the plan accordingly.

Implementation Plan for Ibis Code Model and Embedding System

Implementation Plan: ML-Powered Code Assistant for Ibis
System Goals and Architecture Overview
Our goal is to develop an AI-powered coding assistant specialized for the Ibis framework (a Python library for writing database queries in a pandas-like syntax)
ibis-project.org
. This assistant will support several key workflows for developers:
Semantic Search (Q&A) – Answer questions about Ibis usage or API by searching the Ibis documentation/repository and providing grounded answers.
Code Autocompletion – Provide intelligent code completion suggestions as the developer writes Ibis/Python code (similar to GitHub Copilot or IntelliSense).
Ibis-to-SQL Conversion – Convert Ibis expressions into the corresponding SQL queries on demand, to help developers see the generated SQL
ibis-project.org
.
Error Diagnosis & Repair – Assist in debugging by analyzing error messages or stack traces from Ibis code and suggesting fixes or explanations.
The architecture will center around a large language model (LLM) for code generation and understanding, augmented by an external knowledge base for Ibis-specific information. We will implement a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach
kinde.com
kinde.com
 to keep the model’s responses accurate to the Ibis framework’s actual behavior and documentation. The solution is designed to run on a single high-end GPU machine (preferred NVIDIA A100 40GB for cost efficiency, or H100 if available) without distributed computing, simplifying deployment. Key components of the system will include:
A code-oriented LLM (such as Meta’s Code Llama) deployed on the GPU for all code generation, completion, and reasoning tasks.
An embedding model for semantic search, to vectorize Ibis documentation and code into embeddings for similarity search (enabling the Q&A and debugging workflows without fine-tuning the LLM).
A knowledge database (vector store) populated with content from the Ibis repo and docs, enabling fast retrieval of relevant text/code snippets.
Ancillary logic for Ibis-to-SQL conversion, possibly using the Ibis library itself for 100% accuracy
ibis-project.org
.
Integration interfaces (e.g. extension or API) for the developer’s environment (IDE or chat interface), enabling autocompletion and interactive Q&A.
Below, we detail the architecture and implementation plan for each component and workflow, assuming the role of an ML product manager designing a robust solution.
Hardware and Model Selection
Hardware: We will deploy the system on a single machine equipped with an NVIDIA A100 GPU (40GB VRAM) and ample CPU RAM (64GB+). The A100 40GB provides a good balance of price and performance and is sufficient to host a large code model. If needed, we can consider the 80GB version or newer H100 for larger models, but the 40GB A100 should suffice with model optimizations. Running on one GPU avoids the complexity of multi-GPU model parallelism, aligning with the requirement to avoid parallelization across machines/GPUs. Base LLM for Code: We will use a state-of-the-art open-source code generation LLM. A strong candidate is Code Llama (by Meta) or a derivative like Code Llama-Instruct. Code Llama was specifically trained on programming content (500B tokens including 100B Python code) and can handle long sequences up to 16k tokens
hardware-corner.net
 – ideal for reading large code context or documentation. We can choose a model size that balances capability with inference speed:
13B parameters – smaller, faster, likely fits in ~10GB VRAM with 4-bit quantization
hardware-corner.net
.
34B parameters – larger and more fluent; with 4-bit quantization it uses ~21 GB VRAM
docs.vultr.com
, which is feasible on a 40GB GPU (leaving headroom for intermediate data). This size may provide better accuracy for complex tasks at the cost of some latency.
Given the hardware, we can even consider the 34B model quantized to 4-bit without running out of memory
docs.vultr.com
. Quantization (e.g. using GPTQ or BitsAndBytes) will shrink model memory footprint so that the 34B model fits comfortably in ~20–22GB VRAM
docs.vultr.com
, and the remainder of GPU memory can be used for caching context or accelerating multiple requests. This avoids splitting the model onto multiple GPUs. We will likely opt for Code Llama 34B (Instruct variant) for maximum performance, quantized to 4-bit for single-GPU hosting. Code Llama’s instruct-tuned variant can follow human instructions for tasks like explaining errors or converting code. It also excels at code completion, unit tests generation, etc., making it a good all-in-one model for our use cases
hardware-corner.net
. If inference latency proves high, we have the option to fall back to 13B or use techniques like compilation or partial offloading to CPU, but our preference is to leverage the largest model that our hardware can support to maximize quality. Avoiding Fine-Tuning (LoRA): The user explicitly prefers not to use LoRA or other fine-tuning for the transformer. We will not fine-tune the base LLM’s weights on our domain data. Instead, we will incorporate Ibis-specific knowledge through prompt engineering and retrieval. This has several benefits: it avoids the complexity and expense of training, and it keeps the model flexible, relying on up-to-date external data rather than baking in potentially stale info. In other words, we treat the LLM as a fixed foundation model and achieve domain adaptation via retrieval augmentation (described below) rather than weight updates. This approach is aligned with our hardware constraints as well (fine-tuning a 34B model, even with LoRA, could be memory-intensive and time-consuming). Embedding Model: For implementing semantic search over documentation, we will use a separate embedding model to generate vector representations of text. This model can be much smaller (for example, a sentence-transformer like all-MiniLM or an open source model such as E5 or InstructorXL). The embedding model’s role is to map documentation text or code snippets into a high-dimensional vector space such that semantically similar queries and documents are nearby. We can even use OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 via API for very high-quality embeddings if allowed, but assuming a self-hosted solution, a well-regarded open model will be chosen. This embedding model will run on CPU (or on the GPU when idle) as it is lightweight compared to the main LLM. By using an embedding approach (instead of fine-tuning the LLM with domain data), we ensure that the assistant can ingest new knowledge incrementally and always ground its answers in the latest Ibis information
kinde.com
kinde.com
, addressing the “knowledge boundary” problem of LLMs
arxiv.org
.
Data Ingestion and Knowledge Base Construction
To enable the assistant to answer Ibis-specific questions and reason about errors, we need to build a knowledge base of Ibis-related content. This will combine the official documentation and possibly relevant parts of the source code or examples. 1. Source Data Collection: We will gather data from two primary sources:
Ibis Documentation: Crawl the official Ibis docs site (e.g. tutorials, user guides, API reference on ibis-project.org). This includes “Coming from SQL” guides, usage examples, function reference, etc. These pages explain how Ibis APIs work and common patterns. For example, documentation shows how an Ibis expression like t.select(...).filter(...) corresponds to SQL
ibis-project.org
, which is valuable for our conversion and Q&A tasks.
Ibis GitHub Repository: Clone the Ibis project’s Git repository. The source code contains docstrings, function definitions, and possibly a docs/ folder or examples. While the raw code isn’t as directly readable as prose, it can be useful for answering low-level questions or understanding error messages (e.g., looking up an exception class or default behaviors). We will focus on extracting:
Docstrings and Comments: Many functions in Ibis may have explanatory docstrings. These can be indexed for search so that if a user asks about a specific function, the assistant can retrieve the docstring.
Error messages or exception classes: If the codebase defines custom exceptions or error messages, indexing those could help the assistant recognize them and explain their meaning.
Usage Examples/Notebooks: If the repo includes example notebooks or tests demonstrating usage, those are extremely helpful. We might crawl an examples/ or tutorial/ directory if present.
We will likely skip indexing actual implementation code line-by-line (to avoid noise in retrieval results), focusing instead on textual parts (comments, docs). However, having the function signatures and definitions could help if a user asks “What arguments does ibis.some_function take?” – the assistant could pull that from code.
2. Crawl and Parsing: We will write a crawler or use existing tools to fetch the documentation pages (HTML/Markdown). Each page will be cleaned to remove navigation, then segmented into sections or paragraphs. Similarly, for the repository, we will write a script to iterate through files (limiting to relevant file types like .py for code, maybe .md for any markdown docs). We will extract meaningful chunks:
For docs: likely each heading section or paragraph as a chunk (e.g., a method description, a how-to example).
For code: each top-level class or function docstring as one chunk; possibly the function signature itself as context.
3. Chunking Strategy: We need to split the data into semantic chunks suitable for embedding. Each chunk should be a self-contained piece of information (perhaps 100–300 words) that can answer a specific question
kinde.com
. For example, a chunk might be the explanation of how ibis.groupby().aggregate() works from the docs, or the docstring of the ibis.to_sql function. We will preserve references (like which doc page or file it came from) to provide context and allow the assistant to cite or quote it if needed. 4. Embedding and Indexing: Using our chosen embedding model, we convert each chunk of text into a numerical vector representation
kinde.com
. The vector captures the semantic meaning of the text, enabling semantic search (so that a query like "How do I filter rows in Ibis?" will match a chunk about the filter method even if keywords differ). We will store all embedding vectors in a vector database (such as FAISS, Milvus, or an in-memory index via libraries like Chroma or LangChain). The vector DB will store (vector, chunk_text, source_reference) for each chunk. For efficiency, this indexing is done offline as a one-time (or periodic) build process. After initial ingestion, we’ll have an indexed knowledge base of Ibis. The size of Ibis docs+code is not huge (likely a few MBs of text), so a single machine can easily handle the index in memory. The retrieval latency will be low (a few milliseconds to do a nearest-neighbor search for top-k similar vectors). 5. Maintaining Up-to-date Data: In the future, if Ibis is updated, we should update our knowledge base. We can set up a periodic crawl or connect to the Ibis GitHub to fetch new releases. However, initially we can start with a static snapshot. Not using LoRA fine-tuning means updating the assistant’s knowledge is as simple as re-embedding new docs and adding them to the vector store, which is a major advantage (no retraining needed)
kinde.com
. By completing these steps, we will have a robust domain-specific knowledge base that our LLM can leverage to answer questions accurately. The assistant becomes “deeply knowledgeable” about Ibis by virtue of this private data source, which a generic model alone would not fully know
kinde.com
.
Semantic Search and Retrieval-Augmented Q&A
For user queries about Ibis (e.g. "How do I perform a JOIN in Ibis?" or "What does error X mean?"), the system will employ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
kinde.com
kinde.com
. This dramatically improves the relevance and correctness of answers by grounding the LLM with real documentation content. Workflow:
User Query – The developer can ask a question in natural language (via a chat interface or command palette in the IDE). For example: "How can I cast a column to date type in Ibis?"
Embedding the Query – The query text is passed to the same embedding model to produce a query vector
kinde.com
.
Vector Search – We query the vector database for the top k (e.g. 3–5) chunks that are most semantically relevant to the query vector

. For the cast-to-date example, the search might retrieve a chunk from the docs about type casts or the cast() API in Ibis.
Context Assembly – The retrieved text chunks are collected. We may format them with source indicators or as quoted references. For instance, we might create a prompt section like: “According to the Ibis documentation: <chunk1 content> … <chunk2 content> …”.
LLM Prompting – We then prompt the LLM with an augmented prompt
kinde.com
: this includes the original user question and the retrieved context. For example: Prompt:
"You are an expert Ibis assistant. Answer the question using the provided documentation.
Documentation:
- Ibis provides a cast function to convert types... (doc excerpt)...
- To cast to date: t.column.cast("date")... (doc excerpt)
Question: How to cast a column to date in Ibis?" The model receives both the question and the supporting facts from documentation.
Generation of Answer – The LLM generates a helpful answer, grounded in the retrieved info. It might say: “In Ibis, you can cast a column to date using the cast method. For example: table.column.cast("date")
kinde.com
.” Ideally, the answer will quote or cite the documentation text to increase trust. Because we provided relevant context, the model’s answer is factually correct and specific, rather than a hallucinated guess
kinde.com
.
This RAG process effectively gives our assistant an extended memory of the Ibis docs. Even if the base LLM did not originally know much about Ibis, it can now retrieve exact facts and code snippets. As a result, the assistant becomes “deeply knowledgeable” about the project’s codebase and documentation
kinde.com
, far beyond a stock LLM’s training data limits. Example: If the user asks, "What does t.groupby('foo').aggregate(sum_col=t.bar.sum()) translate to in SQL?", the assistant will retrieve the relevant doc sections about group-by and aggregation. The LLM can then compose an answer like: “It will produce a SQL query grouping by ‘foo’ and computing the sum of ‘bar’. For example: SELECT foo, SUM(bar) AS sum_col FROM table GROUP BY foo.” It might even include the exact SQL if the docs had a similar example. Accuracy and Citations: By grounding answers in actual Ibis reference text, we ensure accuracy and can even have the assistant cite the source of its information (using footnote references to documentation) – useful for user trust. The retrieval step also reduces hallucinations; the model is less likely to invent nonexistent Ibis functions because it will lean on actual text from the docs
kinde.com
. Tech Stack for Retrieval: We will implement this pipeline possibly using a library like LangChain or custom code. The steps (embed query, similarity search, assemble prompt, generate answer) can be orchestrated relatively easily. The vector search will be fast (<100 ms for our dataset), so the main latency is the LLM inference. With a 34B model, we might expect a couple of seconds per answer – acceptable for an interactive Q&A. We will target a top-k of ~3 relevant chunks, as research suggests that providing relevant code snippets and docs significantly helps code generation tasks
arxiv.org
 while too much irrelevant context could confuse the model. Limitations: If a query is entirely new or outside the docs’ scope, the model will do its best using general knowledge. We should detect if retrieval finds nothing (e.g., low similarity scores) and then possibly answer with a fallback “I’m not sure, Ibis docs don’t mention that.” But since Ibis is well-documented, most queries about it should have some match. In summary, the search/Q&A module will allow the assistant to function as an Ibis expert advisor, pulling precise knowledge on demand. This addresses tasks like “What does this function do?”, “Is X supported in Ibis?”, “How to write Y in Ibis?” quickly and correctly, by combining search engine capabilities with LLM reasoning

.
Code Autocompletion Workflow
Another core feature is real-time code autocompletion: as the developer writes code, the assistant suggests the next code snippet or completes the current line. This improves productivity by reducing keystrokes and catching mistakes early. Integration in the IDE: We will integrate the LLM into the developer’s coding environment (e.g., VS Code via an extension, or a JupyterLab plugin). When the user pauses typing or explicitly triggers “autocomplete,” the IDE extension will send the current code context to our backend. The context should include:
Some portion of the current file’s content (e.g., the last few hundred tokens or the function in which the cursor is located). This gives the model awareness of the code written so far.
Possibly some surrounding context like the function signature or imported libraries, which can influence completions. (We have a generous 16k token context window in Code Llama
hardware-corner.net
, so we can include a lot of context if needed).
Prompting for Completion: To get the model to produce a continuation of code, we will use a prompt that consists solely of the code context as-is (for a pure continuation) or possibly a short instruction plus the code. For example, we might send:
# (No explicit question, just code context)
import ibis

t = ibis.table({'col1': 'int', 'col2': 'string'}, name='my_table')
expr = t.groupby('col1').aggregate(
…and ask the model to continue from there. Because Code Llama is a causal language model, if we provide the code prefix, it can naturally continue it. In practice, we might include an identifier for the point to continue (some models support an <FILL_ME> tag or we can just stop the input at the cursor position). If using the Code Llama Instruct model, we might need to format the prompt as an instruction, e.g., "[INST] Complete the following code:\n<code context>[/INST]". However, code-specialized models often are capable of infilling or continuation without special tokens, especially if we use the pure Code Llama (non-instruct) for this mode. We can experiment: possibly run two instances of the model with different prompting formats (one tuned for chat/instructions, one for raw code completion). To keep things simple with one model, we’ll likely find a prompt format that coerces the instruct model to do continuation (for example, providing the code context and ending with an open parenthesis or a new line often makes it continue in code style). No Retrieval in Autocomplete: During live autocompletion, we generally won’t perform a doc search for each keystroke – that would be too slow and likely unnecessary. The LLM’s own learned knowledge plus the immediate code context is usually enough for suggesting the next token. For instance, if the developer starts typing t.filter(, the model (trained on lots of code) will know common patterns – it might suggest the condition inside the filter. Likewise, for expr = t.groupby('col')..., it may suggest .aggregate(...) with the correct syntax. However, because Ibis is a somewhat niche library, the model’s training data might not include tons of Ibis-specific code. Thus, the suggestions might be less accurate for Ibis-specific calls. We will mitigate this in a few ways:
The prior Q&A retrieval feature is always available if the user is unsure about usage. They can quickly query the assistant.
We could consider a lightweight approach to incorporate documentation into the suggestion. For example, when the user types a function name, the IDE could fetch the docstring or signature and show it (standard IDE feature). We might not do full LLM retrieval for each keystroke, but an IDE could show tooltips from documentation (not strictly an LLM task, but a useful integration).
Over time, if we gather usage data, we could fine-tune the model on Ibis code patterns (but since we avoid fine-tuning here, initially we rely on the base model).
Model Inference for Completion: To serve autocomplete with low latency, we will run the model in an optimized inference server. Possibilities include using Hugging Face’s transformers with A100’s Tensor Cores, or faster inference engines like vLLM or FasterTransformer. We will generate only a small number of tokens (maybe suggest the next one or two lines of code at most, to keep it quick). The user can always trigger completion again for more. We will run with a relatively high beam or sampling to get reasonable suggestions, and perhaps generate multiple suggestions (like top 3 completions) if the UI will present a list. Example: Developer types joined = t.join(t2, t.one == t2.key).select( and pauses – the assistant might suggest something like:
    joined = t.join(t2, t.one == t2.key).select(
        t,  # include all columns from t
        (t.two - t2.value).name("diff")
    )
This could come straight from patterns in the Ibis docs (join then select with new column) – if the model doesn’t know it, the user might see an incomplete suggestion. They can always consult the Q&A: "How do I select all columns after join?". But ideally, the model’s training plus seeing similar code in context will allow it to make educated suggestions. The key point is that autocompletion will largely rely on the base model’s learned coding ability. Code Llama is trained with a massive amount of Python and should handle general Python completions well (for loops, pandas-like operations, etc.). The unique Ibis bits might be rarer, but since Ibis uses a fluent API style, the model can infer likely method names (e.g., after .groupby probably comes .aggregate). And if it suggests something slightly off, the user can adjust or query the assistant. Real-time Performance: With a single A100 and a 34B quantized model, we estimate autocompletion latency in the ballpark of ~1-2 seconds for a short suggestion (~20 tokens) if not optimized. We will aim to optimize this (maybe by using a smaller variant for completion if needed or by keeping the model loaded and using batch inference for simultaneous requests). Given this is on-prem, a 1-2 second suggestion may be tolerable, though faster is better. We might experiment with the 13B model for interactive use if 34B is too slow, but initial focus is on capability.
Ibis to SQL Conversion Workflow
Ibis is designed to generate SQL from its expressions, and the assistant will facilitate this by providing a “Ibis to SQL” conversion feature. This is useful for users who want to see the raw SQL underlying their Ibis code, either for learning or debugging. There are a couple of approaches to implement this: 1. Leverage Ibis’s Built-in Compiler: The most straightforward and 100% reliable method is to actually use Ibis itself to do the conversion. The Ibis library provides an API (ibis.to_sql(expr)) that returns the SQL string for a given expression
ibis-project.org
. For example, as the docs show, if you create an expression proj = t.select("two", "one"), calling ibis.to_sql(proj) will output:
SELECT
  "t0"."two",
  "t0"."one"
FROM "my_data" AS "t0"
ibis-project.org
. We can harness this functionality in our system. How: We would need a running Python environment with Ibis installed as part of our backend. When the user asks for a conversion (or perhaps triggers a command in the IDE, like clicking “Show SQL” on an expression), we can execute the relevant Ibis code and call expr.to_sql() (or the equivalent API) to get the SQL. The assistant can then present that SQL to the user. Challenges: There is a potential complexity – the assistant needs the actual ibis.expr object. If the user has written code in an interactive session, we might attempt to evaluate it. For example, if the user highlights code expr = t.group_by('foo').aggregate(total=t.bar.sum()) and asks for SQL, we need to reconstruct expr in a live Ibis context. We could attempt to run the code snippet in a sandbox (with a DuckDB backend for Ibis, as recommended
ibis-project.org
, since DuckDB can operate in-memory without external connection). We would define the schema for t (if it’s an unbound table or if it’s connected to a database, we might need that connection). One approach is to require the user to provide context for conversion. For instance, the user could call a special command like #? to_sql(expr) in chat, or we integrate it into the IDE: if the code is actually running in a notebook, the assistant could call the live object’s to_sql. However, making this seamless might be complex. As a simpler solution, we might support only static analysis conversion for common patterns:
Recognize when the user’s query or message explicitly says something like “convert this Ibis code to SQL” or “what SQL will this produce?”. Then the assistant can attempt to simulate it.
The simulation could use the docs or known patterns to produce SQL. For many straightforward cases, the assistant can do this by analogy (the model has seen the docs, which include many Ibis-to-SQL examples). It might correctly generate the SQL string on its own. But relying purely on the model for this can be error-prone if the query is complex.
Given we want an accurate tool, I’d prioritize executing Ibis:
We will set up a lightweight Ibis environment (DuckDB backend by default, as suggested by Ibis docs
ibis-project.org
).
When conversion is requested, wrap the code in a small stub, e.g., define the tables as needed, then call to_sql.
If successful, return the SQL string. If execution fails (say the code snippet was incomplete or had undefined names), then fall back to the LLM to attempt the conversion or at least explain what the SQL would look like.
2. LLM-Based Conversion (fallback): We can also prompt the LLM to translate Ibis code to SQL as an instruction, using its knowledge or documentation references. For example:
Prompt: “Translate the following Ibis code to its equivalent SQL:\npython\nexpr = table[table.year > 2020].groupby('year').aggregate(total=table.value.sum())\nprint(ibis.to_sql(expr))\n”
The model, especially having seen Ibis docs, might produce:
SELECT
  year,
  SUM(value) AS total
FROM table
WHERE year > 2020
GROUP BY year;
This is something the model can do for many cases, and indeed the Ibis documentation and usage examples will guide it. However, relying on the model alone means there’s a chance of minor syntax errors or misquoted identifiers. Because a deterministic method exists (the Ibis library itself), our plan is to integrate that for correctness. User Experience: We will expose this capability in a convenient way:
In a chat interface, the user can simply ask: “What SQL does this Ibis expression generate?” and include the code. The assistant will respond with the SQL (using the method above internally).
In an IDE, we could add a command (e.g., a right-click menu option "Convert to SQL" when an Ibis expression is selected). The extension can then send that code snippet to the backend for conversion.
The assistant’s answer will be just the SQL text, possibly formatted as a code block for readability.
Example:
User in chat: “Here’s my Ibis query:\npython\nresult = customers.join(orders, customers.id == orders.cust_id)\n .filter(orders.date > '2021-01-01')\n .aggregate(total=orders.amount.sum())\n\nWhat SQL will this produce?”
Assistant might respond (after internally calling conversion):
SELECT 
  customers.*, 
  SUM(orders.amount) AS total 
FROM customers 
JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.cust_id 
WHERE orders.date > '2021-01-01' 
GROUP BY customers.id;
And possibly note that this is the SQL equivalent. This matches what Ibis’s compiler would output (with some differences in formatting or alias naming conventions – which we can preserve as closely as needed). By providing this feature, we help users verify and understand the translation, bridging the gap between Ibis (Python) and SQL. It’s also a check that can help debug if the Ibis expression isn’t doing what they expect.
Error Diagnosis and Repair
When the developer encounters errors (exceptions, stack traces, incorrect outputs), our assistant will act as a first-responder debugger
yongfeng.medium.com
. The goal is to parse the error, explain it, and suggest a fix – essentially an AI “rubber duck” that not only listens but actively helps solve the issue. Error Capture: There are two ways the assistant might get an error:
The developer explicitly asks in the chat: “I got this error: ... How do I fix it?” (pasting the error message and maybe code).
If integrated in an IDE or runtime, the assistant could automatically catch exceptions. For example, a VS Code extension could detect a stack trace in the output and send it to the assistant proactively (similar to how some linters or debuggers work).
For now, we assume the user will provide the error context (to avoid overly invasive behavior). The critical information is the error message and ideally the relevant code snippet around where the error occurred. The user might provide both (e.g., “Here’s my code ... and it throws XYZError on line 12”). Retrieval of Context: Before directly invoking the LLM, we will see if the error message or related terms appear in our knowledge base:
Many frameworks have common error messages documented (or asked on Stack Overflow). If the error is, say, an Ibis-specific error (e.g., “TableNotFoundError” or some type conversion error), our indexed docs or even code may have that term. We’ll perform a quick vector search using the error message as the query. If something relevant comes up (for instance, a documentation section like “Common errors” or a snippet from Ibis source where that error is raised), we’ll include that in the context.
If the error is more generic (like a Python TypeError or ValueError coming from misuse of Ibis API), the knowledge base might not directly have it. In such cases, we rely on the model’s general knowledge.
Assembling the prompt for debugging: We will create a prompt that includes:
A brief instruction to the LLM that it is in “debug assistant” mode.
The relevant code (or excerpt) that produced the error. We might wrap it in markers or a code block.
The error message and stack trace.
Any retrieved documentation snippets (for example, if a function’s usage note or an issue is relevant).
Then a request: e.g., “Explain the error and suggest a fix.”
For example:
[INST] You are an expert debugging assistant. The user has the following code and error.

Code:
```python
expr = t.join(t2, t.key == t2.key).select(t.key, t2.value)
expr = expr.filter(t.nonexistent_column > 0)
Error:
AttributeError: 'Table' object has no attribute 'nonexistent_column'
Relevant Info:
In Ibis, trying to access a column that doesn't exist in the table will raise an AttributeError.
Now, explain what the error means and how to fix it, step by step.[/INST]

**LLM Analysis and Suggestion:** The LLM will process this. Thanks to its training and the context we provided, it should:
- Recognize the error type (e.g., `AttributeError: no attribute 'nonexistent_column'` means the column name is wrong or missing).
- Explain it in plain English: e.g., *“The error indicates that `nonexistent_column` is not found in table `t`. This likely means there's a typo or that column isn't in the schema.”*:contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}
- Suggest a fix or diagnostic: *“Check the table schema for the correct column name. If the column doesn’t exist, you need to add it or use a different name. For example, if you meant `col3`, use `t.col3` instead.”* It might also show how to list columns of `t` if relevant.
- If possible, provide a corrected code snippet. In some cases, it could provide a patch. The Medium example shows suggesting a code change as a diff:contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}. For our scenario, it might simply write the corrected line: `expr = expr.filter(t.existing_column > 0)`.

Because the model has been instruction-tuned, it should produce a well-formulated answer with both **explanation and recommendation**:contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}:contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}. This is valuable for the user to not only fix the bug but understand it, turning a frustrating moment into a learning opportunity.

**Multi-turn interaction:** Often debugging is iterative. The user might apply the suggestion and get a new error, or have a follow-up question: *“Okay, I changed that, now I get a new error.”* Our chat interface will allow multi-turn conversations, and the model (with its context window) can keep the prior discussion for continuity. We will include previous Q&A turns as needed in the prompt so the model can build on them.

**Integration with Tools:** We can enhance this workflow by integrating with external tools:
- *AST parsing:* The blog example used Babel to isolate the relevant code context:contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}. We can do something similar in Python – using `ast` module to find the code block or function around the error line if we have the file. This prevents feeding an entire large file to the model, focusing only on what’s needed (keeping within token limits).
- *Executing tests or printouts:* As a future enhancement, the assistant could suggest *“try this fix”* and even run a test. But initially, it will just propose.
- *Retrieving historical issues:* If we had a database of known issues or StackOverflow Q&As for Ibis, we could query that too (like *“Is this a known bug?”*). We noted future work could include auto-surfacing relevant GitHub issues using embeddings:contentReference[oaicite:42]{index=42} – our system is already set up with an embedding index, so we could extend it to include issue texts or FAQ entries. This is a stretch goal, but the architecture would support adding more content to the knowledge base easily.

**Example scenario:** 
User code tries `table.column_name.str.upper()` and gets an error like *`AttributeError: 'StringScalar' object has no attribute 'str'`*. The assistant would explain: *“Ibis string columns don’t use a `.str` accessor like pandas. This error means you're treating an Ibis string scalar like a pandas Series. Instead, use the string methods directly (e.g., `table.column_name.upper()`).”* Then show the corrected usage. This kind of guidance can save a lot of time searching through docs or forums.

Another example could be a database error surfacing through Ibis, e.g., *“IntegrityError: duplicate key...”* The assistant might not have direct knowledge of the DB’s specifics, but it can explain the concept of a duplicate key constraint and suggest checking the data or schema.

By implementing this **error analysis module**, we essentially give the developer a virtual pair-programmer who **reads error logs and offers solutions** in seconds:contentReference[oaicite:43]{index=43}:contentReference[oaicite:44]{index=44}. This reduces the need for frantic Googling and shortens debug cycles. Moreover, the assistant’s explanations can train developers (junior devs can learn *why* the error happened, not just get a fix):contentReference[oaicite:45]{index=45}.

## System Integration and Workflow Orchestration

Having described each component, we now consider how they interoperate in the complete system. The architecture can be visualized as a pipeline with branching paths for different user requests. Below is an overview of how everything connects:

- **User Interface**: This could be a chat-based UI or an IDE plugin (or both). For conceptual clarity:
  - A *Chat UI* allows the user to converse with the assistant, ask questions, paste errors, etc.
  - An *IDE integration* handles real-time events like autocompletion and maybe one-click queries (for conversion or doc search).
- **Backend Application**: We will implement a backend (for example, a Python server using FastAPI or Node backend) that exposes endpoints or handles socket messages for different functions: `complete_code`, `answer_question`, `convert_code`, `debug_error` etc. This backend will hold:
  - The **LLM model instance** loaded in memory (on the GPU). We might use a library to serve it (like Hugging Face’s text-generation-inference server or our own wrapper).
  - The **vector database** (in memory or a local database) for retrieval.
  - The Ibis execution environment for conversion (if using live conversion).
  - Logic to route requests to the appropriate pipeline.

**Routing logic:** As a product manager with an architecture mindset, I propose a simple control flow based on the type of request:
- If the IDE calls `complete_code` (triggered by user pausing in editor), we route to the **Code Autocomplete pipeline**. That will take the code context and call the LLM for continuation (no retrieval step). It returns the completion suggestions to the IDE plugin, which then displays them to the user.
- If the user enters a natural-language question in chat (or invokes a command like `/ask` in IDE), we route to the **Semantic Q&A pipeline**. This will perform the steps of embedding the query, retrieving docs, and prompting the LLM with context to generate an answer:contentReference[oaicite:46]{index=46}. The answer is then sent back to the client (chat UI or shown in a hover box in IDE).
- If the user specifically requests a conversion (the input can be detected e.g., they say "convert" or the IDE calls a `convert` action with code), we invoke the **Conversion module**. This will either execute the Ibis conversion function or prompt the LLM to do it, then return the SQL result.
- If an error message is received (either via chat or an automated catch), we go to the **Error Debug pipeline**. This may itself use retrieval (for error context) and then call the LLM to produce an explanation/fix:contentReference[oaicite:47]{index=47}. The response is returned to the user.

These pipelines share resources (notably the LLM), so the backend should manage requests carefully. The LLM model can handle one generation at a time (unless we use a multi-threaded serving solution). We might queue requests or have the UI indicate when it's busy ("Generating suggestion..."). Autocomplete requests should be very fast – we might give them higher priority or even run a smaller model in parallel for those if needed.

**Security & Isolation:** Running user code (for conversion or debugging) requires caution. We will sandbox any execution. Since we only need to run Ibis in a limited way, we can restrict it (e.g., use DuckDB with no external file access, limit execution time). This prevents malicious code from the user side from affecting the server. The conversion pipeline must carefully handle user input if we automate execution.

**Logging and Improvement:** We will log interactions (with user consent) to see how the assistant is used. For instance, log what questions are asked, where the assistant fails or produces incorrect answers, etc. This will help future improvements, such as deciding if fine-tuning (full model fine-tune, since LoRA is not desired) on a small dataset of Q&A is needed, or if we should add more docs to the knowledge base. Logging also helps in evaluating effectiveness (we can measure, e.g., how often the suggestions are accepted, or the time saved in debugging).

**Scaling Considerations:** On a single machine, we likely expect a single user or a small team using the assistant. The A100 can handle one request at a time well. If we needed to support multiple concurrent users, we might either need to queue requests or instantiate multiple model processes (which would require more GPUs or switching to CPU for some tasks). But initially, we focus on a single-machine, single-user scenario (e.g., a developer running this for themselves on a workstation or a small server accessible to their team).

**Outline of Data Flow for a Sample Session:**

1. *User starts coding:* They type code, the IDE sends context to `complete_code` -> LLM returns completion. This loop continues as they accept or modify suggestions.
2. *User has a question:* They ask in the chat “How do I do X?”. Backend calls retrieval -> LLM -> Answer returned (with references from docs):contentReference[oaicite:48]{index=48}:contentReference[oaicite:49]{index=49}.
3. *User encounters error:* They paste error or IDE catches it -> Backend gathers context -> (retrieval if needed) -> LLM analyzes -> Answer with explanation/fix:contentReference[oaicite:50]{index=50}.
4. *User wants SQL:* They highlight an expression and trigger convert -> Backend runs Ibis to_sql -> returns SQL string.

Throughout this, the **single LLM model** is effectively multitasking: answering questions, writing code, debugging. This is one benefit of using a powerful unified model – it has the capacity to handle all these modes (especially an instruct code model which was trained on a variety of tasks). 

We might just need to format prompts differently for each task. We will maintain **prompt templates** for each workflow:
- Q&A template (with retrieved docs).
- Autocomplete template (mostly code context).
- Conversion template (if using LLM fallback).
- Debug template (error + code input).

Switching templates tells the model what we want each time.

## Implementation Roadmap

We will implement this project in phases, ensuring that we build incrementally and validate each component:

**Phase 1: Environment Setup and Model Provisioning**
1. **Hardware Prep:** Acquire the target machine (A100 40GB) or equivalent. Set up the necessary drivers (CUDA) and libraries. Ensure we have sufficient CPU RAM and disk (for storing the vector index and model files).
2. **Install ML Frameworks:** Install PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers (or an inference framework of choice). Verify that we can utilize the GPU.
3. **Load Base Model:** Download the chosen LLM (e.g., Code Llama 34B instruct). If using a quantized version (4-bit), use a repository like TheBloke’s GPTQ weights or quantize it ourselves using `bitsandbytes`. Load the model and run a few test inferences to confirm it works on the hardware (e.g., have it complete a simple code snippet).
4. **Set up Embedding Model:** Install or download the embedding model (e.g., `sentence-transformers` model). Test generating an embedding for a sample sentence to ensure it's working.

**Phase 2: Build the Knowledge Base**
5. **Crawl Documentation:** Write a script to fetch Ibis docs. Perhaps use `requests` to get pages or find if the docs are open source (maybe markdown on GitHub). Parse out text content. Store raw text of each section.
6. **Process Repository:** Clone the `ibis-project/ibis` GitHub repo. Write a parser to extract docstrings, class/method definitions, and any relevant markdown files. We might skip very large files or binary files. Focus on `.py` and `.rst/.md`.
7. **Chunk & Index:** Use our chunking strategy to break the content into pieces (likely by paragraphs or logical sections). Embed each chunk using the embedding model. Build a vector index with these embeddings. For initial simplicity, we can use FAISS via `faiss` library in Python. Test the retrieval by doing a few manual queries (e.g., search the index for "group by" or "window function" and see if it returns reasonable chunks).
8. **Validate KB:** Ensure important topics are covered. For example, try to retrieve something about "join", "aggregate", common errors, etc. If something is missing, adjust the data gathering (maybe we missed a part of docs).

**Phase 3: Develop the Backend Services**
9. **Choose Framework:** Implement a backend server in Python (FastAPI or Flask) or Node (if using some JS libraries for ML, but Python seems natural here given PyTorch). Python allows easier integration with Ibis and our models.
10. **API Endpoints:** Define endpoints or RPC handlers:
    - `/complete_code`: accepts code context, returns completion.
    - `/ask`: accepts a user question, performs retrieval and returns answer.
    - `/convert`: accepts code snippet, returns SQL.
    - `/debug`: accepts error and code, returns analysis.
    We might also design a unified `/chat` endpoint that takes a message and an optional context type, but separating can simplify logic.
11. **Integrate LLM Inference:** Use the loaded model to implement the handlers. For example, in `/complete_code`, call `model.generate` with the code context prompt. In `/ask`, perform vector search then call `model.generate` with a prompt containing the docs and question. This will involve prompt crafting as per earlier sections.
12. **Tool Integration (for conversion):** In the `/convert` handler, integrate with Ibis:
    - Possibly use `exec()` to run the code snippet in a restricted namespace that has `import ibis` and a connection (DuckDB). 
    - Capture the output of `ibis.to_sql(expr)`. Return it.
    - Handle exceptions (if conversion fails, catch and fallback to LLM by formatting a prompt "User's Ibis code -> SQL?" and get model output).
13. **Test Handlers Locally:** Manually call these endpoints with sample inputs. For example, test `/ask` with "How to filter rows?" and see the answer (adjust prompt if needed to include retrieved text). Test `/debug` with a known error snippet. Iterate on the prompt templates to get desirable output (this is the **prompt engineering** stage).
14. **Implement Multi-turn Chat Logic:** If we support conversation, we need to track conversation state (prior messages). We can maintain a history for each session (user ID or connection). The prompt for the model will then include some recent QA pairs along with the new question. Ensure the context stays within token limit (16k is large, but we trim older history if needed).
15. **Optimize Performance:** Use streaming generation if possible (send tokens to client as they are generated for a better UX in chat). Ensure the model generation parameters are tuned (maybe use temperature ~0.2 for deterministic code, higher if more creativity needed in answers). For autocomplete, likely use greedy or top-p sampling with low temperature to get deterministic completions.

**Phase 4: Frontend/Interface Development**
16. **Chat Interface:** Develop a minimal web frontend or command-line interface to interact. Could use an existing chat UI framework or just a simple web page with text input. Not the main focus, but necessary for usability. Alternatively, skip if we integrate directly into VS Code.
17. **IDE Extension:** Develop an extension for VS Code (or your IDE of choice) to call our backend:
    - On certain editor events (like pause in typing), call `/complete_code` and insert the suggestion.
    - On a custom command (like "Ask Ibis Assistant"), take selected text or prompt from user, call `/ask` or `/debug` accordingly and show the answer (maybe in a sidebar or pop-up).
    - On right-click "Convert to SQL", call `/convert` and show result.
    This requires knowledge of VS Code extension APIs (for example, using Node and the VS Code extension host to communicate with our Python server via HTTP). We will likely build a basic extension and run the server separately.

18. **User Testing:** Try using the entire system as a user. Write some Ibis code in the IDE with the extension on:
    - Does autocompletion trigger appropriately and give useful suggestions?
    - Ask a documentation question in the chat: check correctness and citation.
    - Introduce a bug and see if debug advice makes sense.
    - Try edge cases (e.g., asking something outside of Ibis domain to see how it responds – it might just do its best with general knowledge, which is fine).
    - Iterate on any issues (if answers are off, refine the retrieval or prompt; if completion is laggy, consider reducing model size or further quantization, etc.).

**Phase 5: Refinement and Deployment**
19. **Address Gaps:** Based on testing, fill any gaps:
    - If some Ibis features aren’t covered in docs (maybe we need to add more data sources, like searching the Ibis issue tracker for known problems).
    - If the model struggles with certain Ibis syntax, consider giving it a few **few-shot examples** in the prompt. E.g., always prepend a system instruction with one example of Ibis code and SQL conversion to guide it.
    - Fine-tune prompts: maybe we add instructions to limit answer length or to always output code in markdown format, etc., as needed.
20. **Documentation:** Document how to use the assistant (for end users) and how each feature is triggered.
21. **Deploy Locally or on Server:** Deploy the backend on the target machine. If for a single user, it could just run on their PC. If for a team, maybe host it on an internal server accessible over LAN. Ensure security (if multi-user, maybe add an auth or restrict to a network).
22. **Monitoring:** Set up basic logging on the server to monitor memory usage (the 40GB GPU should be mostly utilized by the model; ensure no memory leaks) and response times. The A100 is quite powerful, so we expect good throughput.

23. **Future Enhancements (Post-MVP):** 
    - Possibly integrate more **knowledge sources**: e.g., Stack Overflow Q&A for Ibis, or allow the assistant to search the web (if allowed) for extremely novel questions.
    - Enhance the **conversation memory**: maybe summarize long chats to keep context windows small.
    - Add **fine-tuned model versions** for specific tasks if needed (for example, a smaller model just for autocomplete running alongside the big one, if we want faster suggestions).
    - Investigate partial LoRA fine-tuning despite initial preference against it, if we find the base model consistently weak on certain Ibis-specific outputs (this would be a last resort if retrieval alone doesn’t cover some gap).

By following this roadmap, we will arrive at a fully functional **Ibis code assistant** that runs on a single machine, utilizing a large GPU for heavy LLM inference and providing a range of developer assistance features. The plan emphasizes modularity (separate workflows for search, completion, conversion, debug) and uses proven techniques like retrieval augmentation to avoid the pitfalls of limited model knowledge:contentReference[oaicite:51]{index=51}:contentReference[oaicite:52]{index=52}. We’ve prioritized using built-in capabilities (like Ibis’s own SQL generator) to ensure accuracy when possible, and leveraging the LLM’s intelligence for the more open-ended tasks (like debugging and free-form Q&A).

Overall, this implementation will empower developers to use Ibis more effectively: they can get instant answers from docs, autocomplete complex expressions, see the SQL they are generating, and quickly overcome errors – all within one integrated assistant. It’s like having a knowledgeable pair-programmer and tutor for Ibis at their side, running efficiently on local hardware. :contentReference[oaicite:53]{index=53}:contentReference[oaicite:54]{index=54}

Implementation Plan: ML-Powered Code Assistant for Ibis
System Goals and Architecture Overview
Our goal is to develop an AI-powered coding assistant specialized for the Ibis framework (a Python library for writing database queries in a pandas-like syntax)
ibis-project.org
. This assistant will support several key workflows for developers:
Semantic Search (Q&A) – Answer questions about Ibis usage or API by searching the Ibis documentation/repository and providing grounded answers.
Code Autocompletion – Provide intelligent code completion suggestions as the developer writes Ibis/Python code (similar to GitHub Copilot or IntelliSense).
Ibis-to-SQL Conversion – Convert Ibis expressions into the corresponding SQL queries on demand, to help developers see the generated SQL
ibis-project.org
.
Error Diagnosis & Repair – Assist in debugging by analyzing error messages or stack traces from Ibis code and suggesting fixes or explanations.
The architecture will center around a large language model (LLM) for code generation and understanding, augmented by an external knowledge base for Ibis-specific information. We will implement a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach
kinde.com
kinde.com
 to keep the model’s responses accurate to the Ibis framework’s actual behavior and documentation. The solution is designed to run on a single high-end GPU machine (preferred NVIDIA A100 40GB for cost efficiency, or H100 if available) without distributed computing, simplifying deployment. Key components of the system will include:
A code-oriented LLM (such as Meta’s Code Llama) deployed on the GPU for all code generation, completion, and reasoning tasks.
An embedding model for semantic search, to vectorize Ibis documentation and code into embeddings for similarity search (enabling the Q&A and debugging workflows without fine-tuning the LLM).
A knowledge database (vector store) populated with content from the Ibis repo and docs, enabling fast retrieval of relevant text/code snippets.
Ancillary logic for Ibis-to-SQL conversion, possibly using the Ibis library itself for 100% accuracy
ibis-project.org
.
Integration interfaces (e.g. extension or API) for the developer’s environment (IDE or chat interface), enabling autocompletion and interactive Q&A.
Below, we detail the architecture and implementation plan for each component and workflow, assuming the role of an ML product manager designing a robust solution.
Hardware and Model Selection
Hardware: We will deploy the system on a single machine equipped with an NVIDIA A100 GPU (40GB VRAM) and ample CPU RAM (64GB+). The A100 40GB provides a good balance of price and performance and is sufficient to host a large code model. If needed, we can consider the 80GB version or newer H100 for larger models, but the 40GB A100 should suffice with model optimizations. Running on one GPU avoids the complexity of multi-GPU model parallelism, aligning with the requirement to avoid parallelization across machines/GPUs. Base LLM for Code: We will use a state-of-the-art open-source code generation LLM. A strong candidate is Code Llama (by Meta) or a derivative like Code Llama-Instruct. Code Llama was specifically trained on programming content (500B tokens including 100B Python code) and can handle long sequences up to 16k tokens
hardware-corner.net
 – ideal for reading large code context or documentation. We can choose a model size that balances capability with inference speed:
13B parameters – smaller, faster, likely fits in ~10GB VRAM with 4-bit quantization
hardware-corner.net
.
34B parameters – larger and more fluent; with 4-bit quantization it uses ~21 GB VRAM
docs.vultr.com
, which is feasible on a 40GB GPU (leaving headroom for intermediate data). This size may provide better accuracy for complex tasks at the cost of some latency.
Given the hardware, we can even consider the 34B model quantized to 4-bit without running out of memory
docs.vultr.com
. Quantization (e.g. using GPTQ or BitsAndBytes) will shrink model memory footprint so that the 34B model fits comfortably in ~20–22GB VRAM
docs.vultr.com
, and the remainder of GPU memory can be used for caching context or accelerating multiple requests. This avoids splitting the model onto multiple GPUs. We will likely opt for Code Llama 34B (Instruct variant) for maximum performance, quantized to 4-bit for single-GPU hosting. Code Llama’s instruct-tuned variant can follow human instructions for tasks like explaining errors or converting code. It also excels at code completion, unit tests generation, etc., making it a good all-in-one model for our use cases
hardware-corner.net
. If inference latency proves high, we have the option to fall back to 13B or use techniques like compilation or partial offloading to CPU, but our preference is to leverage the largest model that our hardware can support to maximize quality. Avoiding Fine-Tuning (LoRA): The user explicitly prefers not to use LoRA or other fine-tuning for the transformer. We will not fine-tune the base LLM’s weights on our domain data. Instead, we will incorporate Ibis-specific knowledge through prompt engineering and retrieval. This has several benefits: it avoids the complexity and expense of training, and it keeps the model flexible, relying on up-to-date external data rather than baking in potentially stale info. In other words, we treat the LLM as a fixed foundation model and achieve domain adaptation via retrieval augmentation (described below) rather than weight updates. This approach is aligned with our hardware constraints as well (fine-tuning a 34B model, even with LoRA, could be memory-intensive and time-consuming). Embedding Model: For implementing semantic search over documentation, we will use a separate embedding model to generate vector representations of text. This model can be much smaller (for example, a sentence-transformer like all-MiniLM or an open source model such as E5 or InstructorXL). The embedding model’s role is to map documentation text or code snippets into a high-dimensional vector space such that semantically similar queries and documents are nearby. We can even use OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 via API for very high-quality embeddings if allowed, but assuming a self-hosted solution, a well-regarded open model will be chosen. This embedding model will run on CPU (or on the GPU when idle) as it is lightweight compared to the main LLM. By using an embedding approach (instead of fine-tuning the LLM with domain data), we ensure that the assistant can ingest new knowledge incrementally and always ground its answers in the latest Ibis information

Data Ingestion and Knowledge Base Construction
To enable the assistant to answer Ibis-specific questions and reason about errors, we need to build a knowledge base of Ibis-related content. This will combine the official documentation and possibly relevant parts of the source code or examples. 1. Source Data Collection: We will gather data from two primary sources:
Ibis Documentation: Crawl the official Ibis docs site (e.g. tutorials, user guides, API reference on ibis-project.org). This includes “Coming from SQL” guides, usage examples, function reference, etc. These pages explain how Ibis APIs work and common patterns. For example, documentation shows how an Ibis expression like t.select(...).filter(...) corresponds to SQL
ibis-project.org
, which is valuable for our conversion and Q&A tasks.
Ibis GitHub Repository: Clone the Ibis project’s Git repository. The source code contains docstrings, function definitions, and possibly a docs/ folder or examples. While the raw code isn’t as directly readable as prose, it can be useful for answering low-level questions or understanding error messages (e.g., looking up an exception class or default behaviors). We will focus on extracting:
Docstrings and Comments: Many functions in Ibis may have explanatory docstrings. These can be indexed for search so that if a user asks about a specific function, the assistant can retrieve the docstring.
Error messages or exception classes: If the codebase defines custom exceptions or error messages, indexing those could help the assistant recognize them and explain their meaning.
Usage Examples/Notebooks: If the repo includes example notebooks or tests demonstrating usage, those are extremely helpful. We might crawl an examples/ or tutorial/ directory if present.
We will likely skip indexing actual implementation code line-by-line (to avoid noise in retrieval results), focusing instead on textual parts (comments, docs). However, having the function signatures and definitions could help if a user asks “What arguments does ibis.some_function take?” – the assistant could pull that from code.
2. Crawl and Parsing: We will write a crawler or use existing tools to fetch the documentation pages (HTML/Markdown). Each page will be cleaned to remove navigation, then segmented into sections or paragraphs. Similarly, for the repository, we will write a script to iterate through files (limiting to relevant file types like .py for code, maybe .md for any markdown docs). We will extract meaningful chunks:
For docs: likely each heading section or paragraph as a chunk (e.g., a method description, a how-to example).
For code: each top-level class or function docstring as one chunk; possibly the function signature itself as context.
3. Chunking Strategy: We need to split the data into semantic chunks suitable for embedding. Each chunk should be a self-contained piece of information (perhaps 100–300 words) that can answer a specific question
kinde.com
. For example, a chunk might be the explanation of how ibis.groupby().aggregate() works from the docs, or the docstring of the ibis.to_sql function. We will preserve references (like which doc page or file it came from) to provide context and allow the assistant to cite or quote it if needed. 4. Embedding and Indexing: Using our chosen embedding model, we convert each chunk of text into a numerical vector representation
kinde.com
. The vector captures the semantic meaning of the text, enabling semantic search (so that a query like "How do I filter rows in Ibis?" will match a chunk about the filter method even if keywords differ). We will store all embedding vectors in a vector database (such as FAISS, Milvus, or an in-memory index via libraries like Chroma or LangChain). The vector DB will store (vector, chunk_text, source_reference) for each chunk. For efficiency, this indexing is done offline as a one-time (or periodic) build process. After initial ingestion, we’ll have an indexed knowledge base of Ibis. The size of Ibis docs+code is not huge (likely a few MBs of text), so a single machine can easily handle the index in memory. The retrieval latency will be low (a few milliseconds to do a nearest-neighbor search for top-k similar vectors). 5. Maintaining Up-to-date Data: In the future, if Ibis is updated, we should update our knowledge base. We can set up a periodic crawl or connect to the Ibis GitHub to fetch new releases. However, initially we can start with a static snapshot. Not using LoRA fine-tuning means updating the assistant’s knowledge is as simple as re-embedding new docs and adding them to the vector store, which is a major advantage (no retraining needed)
kinde.com
. By completing these steps, we will have a robust domain-specific knowledge base that our LLM can leverage to answer questions accurately. The assistant becomes “deeply knowledgeable” about Ibis by virtue of this private data source, which a generic model alone would not fully know
kinde.com
.
Semantic Search and Retrieval-Augmented Q&A
For user queries about Ibis (e.g. "How do I perform a JOIN in Ibis?" or "What does error X mean?"), the system will employ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
kinde.com
kinde.com
. This dramatically improves the relevance and correctness of answers by grounding the LLM with real documentation content. Workflow:
User Query – The developer can ask a question in natural language (via a chat interface or command palette in the IDE). For example: "How can I cast a column to date type in Ibis?"
Embedding the Query – The query text is passed to the same embedding model to produce a query vector
kinde.com
.
Vector Search – We query the vector database for the top k (e.g. 3–5) chunks that are most semantically relevant to the query vector
kinde.com
. For the cast-to-date example, the search might retrieve a chunk from the docs about type casts or the cast() API in Ibis.
Context Assembly – The retrieved text chunks are collected. We may format them with source indicators or as quoted references. For instance, we might create a prompt section like: “According to the Ibis documentation: <chunk1 content> … <chunk2 content> …”.
LLM Prompting – We then prompt the LLM with an augmented prompt
kinde.com
: this includes the original user question and the retrieved context. For example: Prompt:
"You are an expert Ibis assistant. Answer the question using the provided documentation.
Documentation:
- Ibis provides a cast function to convert types... (doc excerpt)...
- To cast to date: t.column.cast("date")... (doc excerpt)
Question: How to cast a column to date in Ibis?" The model receives both the question and the supporting facts from documentation.
Generation of Answer – The LLM generates a helpful answer, grounded in the retrieved info. It might say: “In Ibis, you can cast a column to date using the cast method. For example: table.column.cast("date")
kinde.com
.” Ideally, the answer will quote or cite the documentation text to increase trust. Because we provided relevant context, the model’s answer is factually correct and specific, rather than a hallucinated guess
kinde.com
.
This RAG process effectively gives our assistant an extended memory of the Ibis docs. Even if the base LLM did not originally know much about Ibis, it can now retrieve exact facts and code snippets. As a result, the assistant becomes “deeply knowledgeable” about the project’s codebase and documentation
kinde.com
, far beyond a stock LLM’s training data limits. Example: If the user asks, "What does t.groupby('foo').aggregate(sum_col=t.bar.sum()) translate to in SQL?", the assistant will retrieve the relevant doc sections about group-by and aggregation. The LLM can then compose an answer like: “It will produce a SQL query grouping by ‘foo’ and computing the sum of ‘bar’. For example: SELECT foo, SUM(bar) AS sum_col FROM table GROUP BY foo.” It might even include the exact SQL if the docs had a similar example. Accuracy and Citations: By grounding answers in actual Ibis reference text, we ensure accuracy and can even have the assistant cite the source of its information (using footnote references to documentation) – useful for user trust. The retrieval step also reduces hallucinations; the model is less likely to invent nonexistent Ibis functions because it will lean on actual text from the docs
kinde.com
. Tech Stack for Retrieval: We will implement this pipeline possibly using a library like LangChain or custom code. The steps (embed query, similarity search, assemble prompt, generate answer) can be orchestrated relatively easily. The vector search will be fast (<100 ms for our dataset), so the main latency is the LLM inference. With a 34B model, we might expect a couple of seconds per answer – acceptable for an interactive Q&A. We will target a top-k of ~3 relevant chunks, as research suggests that providing relevant code snippets and docs significantly helps code generation tasks
arxiv.org
 while too much irrelevant context could confuse the model. Limitations: If a query is entirely new or outside the docs’ scope, the model will do its best using general knowledge. We should detect if retrieval finds nothing (e.g., low similarity scores) and then possibly answer with a fallback “I’m not sure, Ibis docs don’t mention that.” But since Ibis is well-documented, most queries about it should have some match. In summary, the search/Q&A module will allow the assistant to function as an Ibis expert advisor, pulling precise knowledge on demand. This addresses tasks like “What does this function do?”, “Is X supported in Ibis?”, “How to write Y in Ibis?” quickly and correctly, by combining search engine capabilities with LLM reasoning
kinde.com
kinde.com
.
Code Autocompletion Workflow
Another core feature is real-time code autocompletion: as the developer writes code, the assistant suggests the next code snippet or completes the current line. This improves productivity by reducing keystrokes and catching mistakes early. Integration in the IDE: We will integrate the LLM into the developer’s coding environment (e.g., VS Code via an extension, or a JupyterLab plugin). When the user pauses typing or explicitly triggers “autocomplete,” the IDE extension will send the current code context to our backend. The context should include:
Some portion of the current file’s content (e.g., the last few hundred tokens or the function in which the cursor is located). This gives the model awareness of the code written so far.
Possibly some surrounding context like the function signature or imported libraries, which can influence completions. (We have a generous 16k token context window in Code Llama
hardware-corner.net
, so we can include a lot of context if needed).
Prompting for Completion: To get the model to produce a continuation of code, we will use a prompt that consists solely of the code context as-is (for a pure continuation) or possibly a short instruction plus the code. For example, we might send:
# (No explicit question, just code context)
import ibis

t = ibis.table({'col1': 'int', 'col2': 'string'}, name='my_table')
expr = t.groupby('col1').aggregate(
…and ask the model to continue from there. Because Code Llama is a causal language model, if we provide the code prefix, it can naturally continue it. In practice, we might include an identifier for the point to continue (some models support an <FILL_ME> tag or we can just stop the input at the cursor position). If using the Code Llama Instruct model, we might need to format the prompt as an instruction, e.g., "[INST] Complete the following code:\n<code context>[/INST]". However, code-specialized models often are capable of infilling or continuation without special tokens, especially if we use the pure Code Llama (non-instruct) for this mode. We can experiment: possibly run two instances of the model with different prompting formats (one tuned for chat/instructions, one for raw code completion). To keep things simple with one model, we’ll likely find a prompt format that coerces the instruct model to do continuation (for example, providing the code context and ending with an open parenthesis or a new line often makes it continue in code style). No Retrieval in Autocomplete: During live autocompletion, we generally won’t perform a doc search for each keystroke – that would be too slow and likely unnecessary. The LLM’s own learned knowledge plus the immediate code context is usually enough for suggesting the next token. For instance, if the developer starts typing t.filter(, the model (trained on lots of code) will know common patterns – it might suggest the condition inside the filter. Likewise, for expr = t.groupby('col')..., it may suggest .aggregate(...) with the correct syntax. However, because Ibis is a somewhat niche library, the model’s training data might not include tons of Ibis-specific code. Thus, the suggestions might be less accurate for Ibis-specific calls. We will mitigate this in a few ways:
The prior Q&A retrieval feature is always available if the user is unsure about usage. They can quickly query the assistant.
We could consider a lightweight approach to incorporate documentation into the suggestion. For example, when the user types a function name, the IDE could fetch the docstring or signature and show it (standard IDE feature). We might not do full LLM retrieval for each keystroke, but an IDE could show tooltips from documentation (not strictly an LLM task, but a useful integration).
Over time, if we gather usage data, we could fine-tune the model on Ibis code patterns (but since we avoid fine-tuning here, initially we rely on the base model).
Model Inference for Completion: To serve autocomplete with low latency, we will run the model in an optimized inference server. Possibilities include using Hugging Face’s transformers with A100’s Tensor Cores, or faster inference engines like vLLM or FasterTransformer. We will generate only a small number of tokens (maybe suggest the next one or two lines of code at most, to keep it quick). The user can always trigger completion again for more. We will run with a relatively high beam or sampling to get reasonable suggestions, and perhaps generate multiple suggestions (like top 3 completions) if the UI will present a list. Example: Developer types joined = t.join(t2, t.one == t2.key).select( and pauses – the assistant might suggest something like:
    joined = t.join(t2, t.one == t2.key).select(
        t,  # include all columns from t
        (t.two - t2.value).name("diff")
    )
This could come straight from patterns in the Ibis docs (join then select with new column) – if the model doesn’t know it, the user might see an incomplete suggestion. They can always consult the Q&A: "How do I select all columns after join?". But ideally, the model’s training plus seeing similar code in context will allow it to make educated suggestions. The key point is that autocompletion will largely rely on the base model’s learned coding ability. Code Llama is trained with a massive amount of Python and should handle general Python completions well (for loops, pandas-like operations, etc.). The unique Ibis bits might be rarer, but since Ibis uses a fluent API style, the model can infer likely method names (e.g., after .groupby probably comes .aggregate). And if it suggests something slightly off, the user can adjust or query the assistant. Real-time Performance: With a single A100 and a 34B quantized model, we estimate autocompletion latency in the ballpark of ~1-2 seconds for a short suggestion (~20 tokens) if not optimized. We will aim to optimize this (maybe by using a smaller variant for completion if needed or by keeping the model loaded and using batch inference for simultaneous requests). Given this is on-prem, a 1-2 second suggestion may be tolerable, though faster is better. We might experiment with the 13B model for interactive use if 34B is too slow, but initial focus is on capability.
Ibis to SQL Conversion Workflow
Ibis is designed to generate SQL from its expressions, and the assistant will facilitate this by providing a “Ibis to SQL” conversion feature. This is useful for users who want to see the raw SQL underlying their Ibis code, either for learning or debugging. There are a couple of approaches to implement this: 1. Leverage Ibis’s Built-in Compiler: The most straightforward and 100% reliable method is to actually use Ibis itself to do the conversion. The Ibis library provides an API (ibis.to_sql(expr)) that returns the SQL string for a given expression
ibis-project.org
. For example, as the docs show, if you create an expression proj = t.select("two", "one"), calling ibis.to_sql(proj) will output:
SELECT
  "t0"."two",
  "t0"."one"
FROM "my_data" AS "t0"
ibis-project.org
. We can harness this functionality in our system. How: We would need a running Python environment with Ibis installed as part of our backend. When the user asks for a conversion (or perhaps triggers a command in the IDE, like clicking “Show SQL” on an expression), we can execute the relevant Ibis code and call expr.to_sql() (or the equivalent API) to get the SQL. The assistant can then present that SQL to the user. Challenges: There is a potential complexity – the assistant needs the actual ibis.expr object. If the user has written code in an interactive session, we might attempt to evaluate it. For example, if the user highlights code expr = t.group_by('foo').aggregate(total=t.bar.sum()) and asks for SQL, we need to reconstruct expr in a live Ibis context. We could attempt to run the code snippet in a sandbox (with a DuckDB backend for Ibis, as recommended
ibis-project.org
, since DuckDB can operate in-memory without external connection). We would define the schema for t (if it’s an unbound table or if it’s connected to a database, we might need that connection). One approach is to require the user to provide context for conversion. For instance, the user could call a special command like #? to_sql(expr) in chat, or we integrate it into the IDE: if the code is actually running in a notebook, the assistant could call the live object’s to_sql. However, making this seamless might be complex. As a simpler solution, we might support only static analysis conversion for common patterns:
Recognize when the user’s query or message explicitly says something like “convert this Ibis code to SQL” or “what SQL will this produce?”. Then the assistant can attempt to simulate it.
The simulation could use the docs or known patterns to produce SQL. For many straightforward cases, the assistant can do this by analogy (the model has seen the docs, which include many Ibis-to-SQL examples). It might correctly generate the SQL string on its own. But relying purely on the model for this can be error-prone if the query is complex.
Given we want an accurate tool, I’d prioritize executing Ibis:
We will set up a lightweight Ibis environment (DuckDB backend by default, as suggested by Ibis docs
ibis-project.org
).
When conversion is requested, wrap the code in a small stub, e.g., define the tables as needed, then call to_sql.
If successful, return the SQL string. If execution fails (say the code snippet was incomplete or had undefined names), then fall back to the LLM to attempt the conversion or at least explain what the SQL would look like.
2. LLM-Based Conversion (fallback): We can also prompt the LLM to translate Ibis code to SQL as an instruction, using its knowledge or documentation references. For example:
Prompt: “Translate the following Ibis code to its equivalent SQL:\npython\nexpr = table[table.year > 2020].groupby('year').aggregate(total=table.value.sum())\nprint(ibis.to_sql(expr))\n”
The model, especially having seen Ibis docs, might produce:
SELECT
  year,
  SUM(value) AS total
FROM table
WHERE year > 2020
GROUP BY year;
This is something the model can do for many cases, and indeed the Ibis documentation and usage examples will guide it. However, relying on the model alone means there’s a chance of minor syntax errors or misquoted identifiers. Because a deterministic method exists (the Ibis library itself), our plan is to integrate that for correctness. User Experience: We will expose this capability in a convenient way:
In a chat interface, the user can simply ask: “What SQL does this Ibis expression generate?” and include the code. The assistant will respond with the SQL (using the method above internally).
In an IDE, we could add a command (e.g., a right-click menu option "Convert to SQL" when an Ibis expression is selected). The extension can then send that code snippet to the backend for conversion.
The assistant’s answer will be just the SQL text, possibly formatted as a code block for readability.
Example:
User in chat: “Here’s my Ibis query:\npython\nresult = customers.join(orders, customers.id == orders.cust_id)\n .filter(orders.date > '2021-01-01')\n .aggregate(total=orders.amount.sum())\n\nWhat SQL will this produce?”
Assistant might respond (after internally calling conversion):
SELECT 
  customers.*, 
  SUM(orders.amount) AS total 
FROM customers 
JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.cust_id 
WHERE orders.date > '2021-01-01' 
GROUP BY customers.id;
And possibly note that this is the SQL equivalent. This matches what Ibis’s compiler would output (with some differences in formatting or alias naming conventions – which we can preserve as closely as needed). By providing this feature, we help users verify and understand the translation, bridging the gap between Ibis (Python) and SQL. It’s also a check that can help debug if the Ibis expression isn’t doing what they expect.
Error Diagnosis and Repair
When the developer encounters errors (exceptions, stack traces, incorrect outputs), our assistant will act as a first-responder debugger
yongfeng.medium.com
. The goal is to parse the error, explain it, and suggest a fix – essentially an AI “rubber duck” that not only listens but actively helps solve the issue. Error Capture: There are two ways the assistant might get an error:
The developer explicitly asks in the chat: “I got this error: ... How do I fix it?” (pasting the error message and maybe code).
If integrated in an IDE or runtime, the assistant could automatically catch exceptions. For example, a VS Code extension could detect a stack trace in the output and send it to the assistant proactively (similar to how some linters or debuggers work).
For now, we assume the user will provide the error context (to avoid overly invasive behavior). The critical information is the error message and ideally the relevant code snippet around where the error occurred. The user might provide both (e.g., “Here’s my code ... and it throws XYZError on line 12”). Retrieval of Context: Before directly invoking the LLM, we will see if the error message or related terms appear in our knowledge base:
Many frameworks have common error messages documented (or asked on Stack Overflow). If the error is, say, an Ibis-specific error (e.g., “TableNotFoundError” or some type conversion error), our indexed docs or even code may have that term. We’ll perform a quick vector search using the error message as the query. If something relevant comes up (for instance, a documentation section like “Common errors” or a snippet from Ibis source where that error is raised), we’ll include that in the context.
If the error is more generic (like a Python TypeError or ValueError coming from misuse of Ibis API), the knowledge base might not directly have it. In such cases, we rely on the model’s general knowledge.
Assembling the prompt for debugging: We will create a prompt that includes:
A brief instruction to the LLM that it is in “debug assistant” mode.
The relevant code (or excerpt) that produced the error. We might wrap it in markers or a code block.
The error message and stack trace.
Any retrieved documentation snippets (for example, if a function’s usage note or an issue is relevant).
Then a request: e.g., “Explain the error and suggest a fix.”
For example:
[INST] You are an expert debugging assistant. The user has the following code and error.

Code:
```python
expr = t.join(t2, t.key == t2.key).select(t.key, t2.value)
expr = expr.filter(t.nonexistent_column > 0)
Error:
AttributeError: 'Table' object has no attribute 'nonexistent_column'
Relevant Info:
In Ibis, trying to access a column that doesn't exist in the table will raise an AttributeError.
Now, explain what the error means and how to fix it, step by step.[/INST]

**LLM Analysis and Suggestion:** The LLM will process this. Thanks to its training and the context we provided, it should:
- Recognize the error type (e.g., `AttributeError: no attribute 'nonexistent_column'` means the column name is wrong or missing).
- Explain it in plain English: e.g., *“The error indicates that `nonexistent_column` is not found in table `t`. This likely means there's a typo or that column isn't in the schema.”*:contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}
- Suggest a fix or diagnostic: *“Check the table schema for the correct column name. If the column doesn’t exist, you need to add it or use a different name. For example, if you meant `col3`, use `t.col3` instead.”* It might also show how to list columns of `t` if relevant.
- If possible, provide a corrected code snippet. In some cases, it could provide a patch. The Medium example shows suggesting a code change as a diff:contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}. For our scenario, it might simply write the corrected line: `expr = expr.filter(t.existing_column > 0)`.

Because the model has been instruction-tuned, it should produce a well-formulated answer with both **explanation and recommendation**:contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}:contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}. This is valuable for the user to not only fix the bug but understand it, turning a frustrating moment into a learning opportunity.

**Multi-turn interaction:** Often debugging is iterative. The user might apply the suggestion and get a new error, or have a follow-up question: *“Okay, I changed that, now I get a new error.”* Our chat interface will allow multi-turn conversations, and the model (with its context window) can keep the prior discussion for continuity. We will include previous Q&A turns as needed in the prompt so the model can build on them.

**Integration with Tools:** We can enhance this workflow by integrating with external tools:
- *AST parsing:* The blog example used Babel to isolate the relevant code context:contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}. We can do something similar in Python – using `ast` module to find the code block or function around the error line if we have the file. This prevents feeding an entire large file to the model, focusing only on what’s needed (keeping within token limits).
- *Executing tests or printouts:* As a future enhancement, the assistant could suggest *“try this fix”* and even run a test. But initially, it will just propose.
- *Retrieving historical issues:* If we had a database of known issues or StackOverflow Q&As for Ibis, we could query that too (like *“Is this a known bug?”*). We noted future work could include auto-surfacing relevant GitHub issues using embeddings:contentReference[oaicite:42]{index=42} – our system is already set up with an embedding index, so we could extend it to include issue texts or FAQ entries. This is a stretch goal, but the architecture would support adding more content to the knowledge base easily.

**Example scenario:** 
User code tries `table.column_name.str.upper()` and gets an error like *`AttributeError: 'StringScalar' object has no attribute 'str'`*. The assistant would explain: *“Ibis string columns don’t use a `.str` accessor like pandas. This error means you're treating an Ibis string scalar like a pandas Series. Instead, use the string methods directly (e.g., `table.column_name.upper()`).”* Then show the corrected usage. This kind of guidance can save a lot of time searching through docs or forums.

Another example could be a database error surfacing through Ibis, e.g., *“IntegrityError: duplicate key...”* The assistant might not have direct knowledge of the DB’s specifics, but it can explain the concept of a duplicate key constraint and suggest checking the data or schema.

By implementing this **error analysis module**, we essentially give the developer a virtual pair-programmer who **reads error logs and offers solutions** in seconds:contentReference[oaicite:43]{index=43}:contentReference[oaicite:44]{index=44}. This reduces the need for frantic Googling and shortens debug cycles. Moreover, the assistant’s explanations can train developers (junior devs can learn *why* the error happened, not just get a fix):contentReference[oaicite:45]{index=45}.

## System Integration and Workflow Orchestration

Having described each component, we now consider how they interoperate in the complete system. The architecture can be visualized as a pipeline with branching paths for different user requests. Below is an overview of how everything connects:

- **User Interface**: This could be a chat-based UI or an IDE plugin (or both). For conceptual clarity:
  - A *Chat UI* allows the user to converse with the assistant, ask questions, paste errors, etc.
  - An *IDE integration* handles real-time events like autocompletion and maybe one-click queries (for conversion or doc search).
- **Backend Application**: We will implement a backend (for example, a Python server using FastAPI or Node backend) that exposes endpoints or handles socket messages for different functions: `complete_code`, `answer_question`, `convert_code`, `debug_error` etc. This backend will hold:
  - The **LLM model instance** loaded in memory (on the GPU). We might use a library to serve it (like Hugging Face’s text-generation-inference server or our own wrapper).
  - The **vector database** (in memory or a local database) for retrieval.
  - The Ibis execution environment for conversion (if using live conversion).
  - Logic to route requests to the appropriate pipeline.

**Routing logic:** As a product manager with an architecture mindset, I propose a simple control flow based on the type of request:
- If the IDE calls `complete_code` (triggered by user pausing in editor), we route to the **Code Autocomplete pipeline**. That will take the code context and call the LLM for continuation (no retrieval step). It returns the completion suggestions to the IDE plugin, which then displays them to the user.
- If the user enters a natural-language question in chat (or invokes a command like `/ask` in IDE), we route to the **Semantic Q&A pipeline**. This will perform the steps of embedding the query, retrieving docs, and prompting the LLM with context to generate an answer:contentReference[oaicite:46]{index=46}. The answer is then sent back to the client (chat UI or shown in a hover box in IDE).
- If the user specifically requests a conversion (the input can be detected e.g., they say "convert" or the IDE calls a `convert` action with code), we invoke the **Conversion module**. This will either execute the Ibis conversion function or prompt the LLM to do it, then return the SQL result.
- If an error message is received (either via chat or an automated catch), we go to the **Error Debug pipeline**. This may itself use retrieval (for error context) and then call the LLM to produce an explanation/fix:contentReference[oaicite:47]{index=47}. The response is returned to the user.

These pipelines share resources (notably the LLM), so the backend should manage requests carefully. The LLM model can handle one generation at a time (unless we use a multi-threaded serving solution). We might queue requests or have the UI indicate when it's busy ("Generating suggestion..."). Autocomplete requests should be very fast – we might give them higher priority or even run a smaller model in parallel for those if needed.

**Security & Isolation:** Running user code (for conversion or debugging) requires caution. We will sandbox any execution. Since we only need to run Ibis in a limited way, we can restrict it (e.g., use DuckDB with no external file access, limit execution time). This prevents malicious code from the user side from affecting the server. The conversion pipeline must carefully handle user input if we automate execution.

**Logging and Improvement:** We will log interactions (with user consent) to see how the assistant is used. For instance, log what questions are asked, where the assistant fails or produces incorrect answers, etc. This will help future improvements, such as deciding if fine-tuning (full model fine-tune, since LoRA is not desired) on a small dataset of Q&A is needed, or if we should add more docs to the knowledge base. Logging also helps in evaluating effectiveness (we can measure, e.g., how often the suggestions are accepted, or the time saved in debugging).

**Scaling Considerations:** On a single machine, we likely expect a single user or a small team using the assistant. The A100 can handle one request at a time well. If we needed to support multiple concurrent users, we might either need to queue requests or instantiate multiple model processes (which would require more GPUs or switching to CPU for some tasks). But initially, we focus on a single-machine, single-user scenario (e.g., a developer running this for themselves on a workstation or a small server accessible to their team).

**Outline of Data Flow for a Sample Session:**

1. *User starts coding:* They type code, the IDE sends context to `complete_code` -> LLM returns completion. This loop continues as they accept or modify suggestions.
2. *User has a question:* They ask in the chat “How do I do X?”. Backend calls retrieval -> LLM -> Answer returned (with references from docs):contentReference[oaicite:48]{index=48}:contentReference[oaicite:49]{index=49}.
3. *User encounters error:* They paste error or IDE catches it -> Backend gathers context -> (retrieval if needed) -> LLM analyzes -> Answer with explanation/fix:contentReference[oaicite:50]{index=50}.
4. *User wants SQL:* They highlight an expression and trigger convert -> Backend runs Ibis to_sql -> returns SQL string.

Throughout this, the **single LLM model** is effectively multitasking: answering questions, writing code, debugging. This is one benefit of using a powerful unified model – it has the capacity to handle all these modes (especially an instruct code model which was trained on a variety of tasks). 

We might just need to format prompts differently for each task. We will maintain **prompt templates** for each workflow:
- Q&A template (with retrieved docs).
- Autocomplete template (mostly code context).
- Conversion template (if using LLM fallback).
- Debug template (error + code input).

Switching templates tells the model what we want each time.

## Implementation Roadmap

We will implement this project in phases, ensuring that we build incrementally and validate each component:

**Phase 1: Environment Setup and Model Provisioning**
1. **Hardware Prep:** Acquire the target machine (A100 40GB) or equivalent. Set up the necessary drivers (CUDA) and libraries. Ensure we have sufficient CPU RAM and disk (for storing the vector index and model files).
2. **Install ML Frameworks:** Install PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers (or an inference framework of choice). Verify that we can utilize the GPU.
3. **Load Base Model:** Download the chosen LLM (e.g., Code Llama 34B instruct). If using a quantized version (4-bit), use a repository like TheBloke’s GPTQ weights or quantize it ourselves using `bitsandbytes`. Load the model and run a few test inferences to confirm it works on the hardware (e.g., have it complete a simple code snippet).
4. **Set up Embedding Model:** Install or download the embedding model (e.g., `sentence-transformers` model). Test generating an embedding for a sample sentence to ensure it's working.

**Phase 2: Build the Knowledge Base**
5. **Crawl Documentation:** Write a script to fetch Ibis docs. Perhaps use `requests` to get pages or find if the docs are open source (maybe markdown on GitHub). Parse out text content. Store raw text of each section.
6. **Process Repository:** Clone the `ibis-project/ibis` GitHub repo. Write a parser to extract docstrings, class/method definitions, and any relevant markdown files. We might skip very large files or binary files. Focus on `.py` and `.rst/.md`.
7. **Chunk & Index:** Use our chunking strategy to break the content into pieces (likely by paragraphs or logical sections). Embed each chunk using the embedding model. Build a vector index with these embeddings. For initial simplicity, we can use FAISS via `faiss` library in Python. Test the retrieval by doing a few manual queries (e.g., search the index for "group by" or "window function" and see if it returns reasonable chunks).
8. **Validate KB:** Ensure important topics are covered. For example, try to retrieve something about "join", "aggregate", common errors, etc. If something is missing, adjust the data gathering (maybe we missed a part of docs).

**Phase 3: Develop the Backend Services**
9. **Choose Framework:** Implement a backend server in Python (FastAPI or Flask) or Node (if using some JS libraries for ML, but Python seems natural here given PyTorch). Python allows easier integration with Ibis and our models.
10. **API Endpoints:** Define endpoints or RPC handlers:
    - `/complete_code`: accepts code context, returns completion.
    - `/ask`: accepts a user question, performs retrieval and returns answer.
    - `/convert`: accepts code snippet, returns SQL.
    - `/debug`: accepts error and code, returns analysis.
    We might also design a unified `/chat` endpoint that takes a message and an optional context type, but separating can simplify logic.
11. **Integrate LLM Inference:** Use the loaded model to implement the handlers. For example, in `/complete_code`, call `model.generate` with the code context prompt. In `/ask`, perform vector search then call `model.generate` with a prompt containing the docs and question. This will involve prompt crafting as per earlier sections.
12. **Tool Integration (for conversion):** In the `/convert` handler, integrate with Ibis:
    - Possibly use `exec()` to run the code snippet in a restricted namespace that has `import ibis` and a connection (DuckDB). 
    - Capture the output of `ibis.to_sql(expr)`. Return it.
    - Handle exceptions (if conversion fails, catch and fallback to LLM by formatting a prompt "User's Ibis code -> SQL?" and get model output).
13. **Test Handlers Locally:** Manually call these endpoints with sample inputs. For example, test `/ask` with "How to filter rows?" and see the answer (adjust prompt if needed to include retrieved text). Test `/debug` with a known error snippet. Iterate on the prompt templates to get desirable output (this is the **prompt engineering** stage).
14. **Implement Multi-turn Chat Logic:** If we support conversation, we need to track conversation state (prior messages). We can maintain a history for each session (user ID or connection). The prompt for the model will then include some recent QA pairs along with the new question. Ensure the context stays within token limit (16k is large, but we trim older history if needed).
15. **Optimize Performance:** Use streaming generation if possible (send tokens to client as they are generated for a better UX in chat). Ensure the model generation parameters are tuned (maybe use temperature ~0.2 for deterministic code, higher if more creativity needed in answers). For autocomplete, likely use greedy or top-p sampling with low temperature to get deterministic completions.

**Phase 4: Frontend/Interface Development**
16. **Chat Interface:** Develop a minimal web frontend or command-line interface to interact. Could use an existing chat UI framework or just a simple web page with text input. Not the main focus, but necessary for usability. Alternatively, skip if we integrate directly into VS Code.
17. **IDE Extension:** Develop an extension for VS Code (or your IDE of choice) to call our backend:
    - On certain editor events (like pause in typing), call `/complete_code` and insert the suggestion.
    - On a custom command (like "Ask Ibis Assistant"), take selected text or prompt from user, call `/ask` or `/debug` accordingly and show the answer (maybe in a sidebar or pop-up).
    - On right-click "Convert to SQL", call `/convert` and show result.
    This requires knowledge of VS Code extension APIs (for example, using Node and the VS Code extension host to communicate with our Python server via HTTP). We will likely build a basic extension and run the server separately.

18. **User Testing:** Try using the entire system as a user. Write some Ibis code in the IDE with the extension on:
    - Does autocompletion trigger appropriately and give useful suggestions?
    - Ask a documentation question in the chat: check correctness and citation.
    - Introduce a bug and see if debug advice makes sense.
    - Try edge cases (e.g., asking something outside of Ibis domain to see how it responds – it might just do its best with general knowledge, which is fine).
    - Iterate on any issues (if answers are off, refine the retrieval or prompt; if completion is laggy, consider reducing model size or further quantization, etc.).

**Phase 5: Refinement and Deployment**
19. **Address Gaps:** Based on testing, fill any gaps:
    - If some Ibis features aren’t covered in docs (maybe we need to add more data sources, like searching the Ibis issue tracker for known problems).
    - If the model struggles with certain Ibis syntax, consider giving it a few **few-shot examples** in the prompt. E.g., always prepend a system instruction with one example of Ibis code and SQL conversion to guide it.
    - Fine-tune prompts: maybe we add instructions to limit answer length or to always output code in markdown format, etc., as needed.
20. **Documentation:** Document how to use the assistant (for end users) and how each feature is triggered.
21. **Deploy Locally or on Server:** Deploy the backend on the target machine. If for a single user, it could just run on their PC. If for a team, maybe host it on an internal server accessible over LAN. Ensure security (if multi-user, maybe add an auth or restrict to a network).
22. **Monitoring:** Set up basic logging on the server to monitor memory usage (the 40GB GPU should be mostly utilized by the model; ensure no memory leaks) and response times. The A100 is quite powerful, so we expect good throughput.

23. **Future Enhancements (Post-MVP):** 
    - Possibly integrate more **knowledge sources**: e.g., Stack Overflow Q&A for Ibis, or allow the assistant to search the web (if allowed) for extremely novel questions.
    - Enhance the **conversation memory**: maybe summarize long chats to keep context windows small.
    - Add **fine-tuned model versions** for specific tasks if needed (for example, a smaller model just for autocomplete running alongside the big one, if we want faster suggestions).
    - Investigate partial LoRA fine-tuning despite initial preference against it, if we find the base model consistently weak on certain Ibis-specific outputs (this would be a last resort if retrieval alone doesn’t cover some gap).

By following this roadmap, we will arrive at a fully functional **Ibis code assistant** that runs on a single machine, utilizing a large GPU for heavy LLM inference and providing a range of developer assistance features. The plan emphasizes modularity (separate workflows for search, completion, conversion, debug) and uses proven techniques like retrieval augmentation to avoid the pitfalls of limited model knowledge:contentReference[oaicite:51]{index=51}:contentReference[oaicite:52]{index=52}. We’ve prioritized using built-in capabilities (like Ibis’s own SQL generator) to ensure accuracy when possible, and leveraging the LLM’s intelligence for the more open-ended tasks (like debugging and free-form Q&A).

Overall, this implementation will empower developers to use Ibis more effectively: they can get instant answers from docs, autocomplete complex expressions, see the SQL they are generating, and quickly overcome errors – all within one integrated assistant. It’s like having a knowledgeable pair-programmer and tutor for Ibis at their side, running efficiently on local hardware. :contentReference[oaicite:53]{index=53}:contentReference[oaicite:54]{index=54}
