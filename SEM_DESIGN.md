Why Semgrep + Serena over regex

Semantics, not strings. Semgrep matches real code structures (AST/meta-variables), not just text, and supports many languages; it’s designed for security rules but doubles as a precise code pattern engine.

Beyond-regex detection. Their “Semgrep Secrets” docs explain the advantage over regex: understanding how data is used (semantic analysis) reduces false positives—same benefit you want for DSL idioms.

Language coverage & fallbacks. Semgrep can do generic pattern matching where a full parser isn’t available—useful for mixed files / notebooks.

Serena = symbolic layer. Serena exposes an MCP/LSP-backed toolkit (symbol-level code retrieval, cross-file refs, editing) so an LLM/agent can navigate code like an IDE—perfect for building your “semantic intelligence” index pre-chunking.

Proposed semantic-intelligence pipeline (pre-chunk & pre-embed)

Source sweep & parsers

Run Semgrep over the repo with a small ruleset that targets your DSL idioms (Ibis API surfaces, common anti-patterns, schema ops). Output matches + captures (metavariables, locations). 
Semgrep

Spin up Serena (MCP server) tied to project LSPs to extract symbols, definitions, references, call-graph edges, and docstrings; store as a symbol graph (JSONL).

Semantic units, not lines

Define chunk types you’ll embed/index: symbol blocks (function/class/method), operator cards (e.g., Ibis .group_by, .mutate), recipe snippets (join→aggregate pipelines), error exemplars (exception + minimal fix).

For each unit, attach:

AST slice (Semgrep match or LSP range)

Symbol links (defs/refs via Serena)

Tags: op kind, backend capability, schema in/out (if you can compute via a quick dry-run)

Provenance (file, commit, version)

Relationship graph

Use Serena edges to build cross-file relation graph: symbol→symbol, symbol→doc, symbol→test. This powers neighborhood expansion in retrieval (e.g., when asking about .aggregate, also surface relevant tests and examples). 
LobeHub

Embedding strategy (hybrid)

Embed content (docs/snippets) and structure (compact graph features) separately; store both vectors. Retrieval = content vector + re-rank with structural proximity (same symbol, same op family, nearby graph neighborhood).

Keep a “rule hits” index: Semgrep findings become filters/boosts in your retriever (e.g., boost chunks that matched “window-with-order” when the query mentions windowing).

Guardrails for training & inference

During data mining for LoRA: only keep examples whose chunks pass a quick compile/type-check (tool-verified) and whose Semgrep tags confirm the intended pattern. This trims noisy supervision upfront.

During inference: when the user asks “how do I X?”, the retriever uses semantic tags (op=JOIN, key=…, window=true) and Serena’s symbol graph to fetch the right few shots for the prompt.

How it plugs into your Devstral + LoRA + tools stack

Retrieval (RAG) quality jump. Your prompts get minimal, on-topic snippets with schema breadcrumbs and operator intent—far better than regex-cut paragraphs. Semgrep tags let you compose targeted contexts (“anti-join”, “window+partition”) quickly. 
Semgrep

Autocomplete priors. Feed Serena symbol context (current function, imports, available table/column names) as tool state to Devstral; mask suggestions accordingly. Serena shines at symbol-level navigation/editing for agentic flows. 
LobeHub

Error repair. Map stack traces to symbols/locations via Serena, then fetch Semgrep-tagged counterexamples (“mismatched key join”, “illegal pushdown”), pass to the model + run compiler/typechecker loop.

What to build (pragmatic steps)

Author a tiny Semgrep rulepack for Ibis

Rules for: .group_by().aggregate(), joins (inner/left), window ops (partition/order), filter-pushdown smells, Pandas-ism misuse (.str accessor), backend-unsupported ops.

Start small (10–20 rules); iterate as you see false positives. 
Semgrep

Stand up Serena

Run the Serena MCP server against your repo; cache symbols, defs/refs, file→symbol map. Confirm cross-file navigation and editing tools are live.

Semantic chunker

Build a job that:

Reads Semgrep JSON + Serena symbols

Emits chunk records (text, code, tags, edges)

Writes to your vector store + a graph sidecar (for re-ranking)

Retriever v1

Query = (embedding of NL/code) + filters/boosts from parsed query intent (map tokens like “window”, “rolling”, “anti-join” to tags).

Re-rank top-k by graph proximity (same symbol, neighbors, same op tag).

Training data miner

Use the semantic index to mine tool-verified pairs (intent → code, code ↔ SQL, error → minimal fix). Ensure each example’s code passes compile/typecheck.

Feed these to your LoRA adapters (autocomplete/repair/convert).

Eval harness

Tag each test with op taxonomy (join, window, agg, etc.) using Semgrep; stratify metrics by tag so you see where you’re strong/weak.

Trade-offs & caveats

Parser drift / coverage. Semgrep’s parsers cover many languages and have generic modes, but some DSL-in-Python constructs may need custom patterns; expect to iterate on rules.

Semgrep

Rule maintenance cost. You’re curating a small rulepack—worth it for precision, but budget time to tune false positives/negatives. (Good news: rules are concise and debuggable.) 
Semgrep

Serena maturity. It’s fast-moving OSS; great capabilities (symbolic retrieval/editing via MCP/LSP), but pin versions and monitor updates.

Performance. Running Semgrep + LSP indexing is an offline/build step; retrieval remains fast at runtime. Keep the graph sidecar compact.

If I were shipping this tomorrow

Pilot on Ibis: build 15 Semgrep rules, index a repo with Serena, generate 50–100 high-quality semantic chunks per op family.

Wire retriever into your Devstral prompts; compare answer quality & token efficiency vs regex-chunks.

Feed miner → LoRA with only tool-verified, semantically tagged examples; measure first-pass validity and repair iterations.

Iterate: add rules where retrieval fails; enrich symbol graph with simple schema annotations (table/column types) to help masking and prompt conditioning.

Bottom line: Yes, it makes sense. Semgrep gives you pattern-accurate code slices and Serena gives you symbolic context and relations. Together they form a solid semantic layer so your retrieval, prompts, and LoRA data are about the right things—and your compiler/typechecker loop spends time validating promising candidates, not cleaning up regex noise.
